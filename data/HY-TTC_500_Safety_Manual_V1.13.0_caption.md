## 1 Introduction

Category: Comment ID: 1244013 TTControl has taken care and attention in order to develop the HY-TTC 500 platform with extraordinary diligence. However, the system integrator is advised to immediately contact TTControl, if malfunctioning or uncertainties regarding the HY-TTC 500 platform arise contrary to specifications.

## 1.1 Purpose

Category: Comment ID: 544461 This document represents the manual for integration of the HY-TTC 500 platform into safety-critical systems. The HY-TTC 500 family's variants (i.e. HY-TTC 508, HY-TTC 510, HY-TTC 520, HY-TTC 540, HY-TTC 580, HY-TTC 590 and HY-TTC 590E) only differ in their I/O and partly memory sets, while featuring the same safety mechanisms with regards to functional safety. Consequently, this Safety Manual is valid for the variants HY-TTC 508, HY-TTC 510, HY-TTC 520, HY-TTC 540, HY-TTC 580, HYTTC 590 and HY-TTC 590E equally, otherwise it is stated in the respective requirement/comment. 

For a detailed description of the ECU variants, please refer to the HY-TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500- SysM], Part I: Hardware Description.

For simplification, all HY-TTC 500 family variants will be called HY-TTC 500 throughout this document, after the product family of safety-certified user-programmable ECUs.

This document frequently refers to the "system integrator". The system integrator is the person who is responsible for the integration of the HY-TTC 500 into a safety-related system. The system integrator is responsible for the integration of the HY-TTC 500 into the overall functional safety concept of the integrated system. This means that the requirements described by this document have to be fulfilled by the system integrator to reach the specified level of safety integrity.

The system integrator is able to check whether the HY-TTC 500 platform is suitable for the intended functional safety concept of the integrated system by analyzing
- the overall system's safety requirements
- the Safety Manual (this document).

Category: Requirement Label: ID: 3065953 Related To: Related To':
To guarantee proper safety integrity the device **shall** not be used after the maximum lifetime of 20 years.

Category: Comment ID: 3065955 After a lifetime of 20 years, the device's probabilistic metrics cannot be seen as constant anymore (failure rates, PFH) and therefore the targeted Performance (PL) and Safety Integrity Level (SIL) cannot be guaranteed. For this reason, operating a device in a safety critical application after 20 years is in full responsibility of the system integrator.

Category: Requirement Label: Contact_Support ID: 729965 Related To: Related To':
The system integrator **shall** contact TTControl support (support@ttcontrol.com) if safety-related incidents occur during the integration or operation of the HY-TTC 500 platform.

Category: Comment ID: 586708 For the electrical specification of the HY-TTC 500, please refer to the HY-TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM], Part I: Hardware Description. The knowledge of the electrical specification, especially the characteristics and maximum ratings of the I/Os is required for the integration into a safety-critical system.

For the documentation of the I/O drivers, including information on how to use these drivers in safety related applications, refer to the HY-TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM], Part II: Software Description. Check the release notes for known issues and their impact on the ECU's functions.

The HY-TTC 500 platform cannot guarantee safe operation of the system as a whole. Therefore, certain requirements and constraints have to be fulfilled by the application software as described in this document. Also, a functional safety assessment has to be conducted for the final system according to the system's applicable standards and norms.

Category: Comment ID: 586702 The HY-TTC 500 platform fulfills the requirements of the following safety standards and their assigned safety/performance levels:
- ISO 13849 Category 2, Performance Level d. - IEC 61508 Safety Integrity Level 2.

- ISO 25119 AgPL d/SRL 2.

-

-
The HY-TTC 500 platform may also fulfill the requirements of the ISO 26262 series of standards, however this Safety Manual alone does NOT cover all necessary requirements to use the platform in an ISO 26262 related environment. If the platform will be used in an ISO 26262 related environment the customer needs to fulfil the requirements in this Safety Manual and the ISO 26262 Safety Manual 
[TTC500-SM-26262] addon.

Category: Comment ID: 4572941 The HY-TTC 500 platform allows the system integrator to realize mixed criticality applications (applications containing safe and unsafe code).

Therefore, mechanisms for temporal and spatial separation have been considered during development. Temporal separation is already ensured by design, but spatial separation needs to be implemented by the application software (see section '*Memory Protection Unit*').

For further information regarding mixed criticality please contact TTControl support 
(support@ttcontrol.com).

Category: Requirement Label: ID: 4572481 Related To: Related To':

## 2 Safety Lifecycle - - -

Category: Comment ID: 586714 Due to the HY-TTC 500 platform's nature of being a generic control unit for diverse safety-critical applications, the execution of the IEC 61508, ISO 13849 and ISO 25119 safety lifecycle phases are based on specific assumptions for the overall system. These assumptions are listed within the following document and need to be considered by the system integrator.

Category: Comment ID: 3074044 The following subsections list the corresponding safety lifecycle phases and/or activities partly (e.g. 

overall system phases only applied on ECU level, ...) or completely considered in the course of the HYTTC 500 platform development. Caused by the platforms nature, only a subset of phases/activities have been applied to the HY-TTC 500 which means all other lifecycle phases/activities have to be considered in the course of the system development by the system integrator. Although a phase/activity has already been considered on HY-TTC 500 ECU level, it does not mean that it is not also relevant for the system integrator on system level.

## 3 Safety Concept Overview - - -

Category: Comment ID: 586811 Special hardware and software functions are integrated into the HY-TTC 500 platform that allow the use in safety-critical applications. The following hardware and software components are part of the safety platform:
- **ECU hardware:** The HY-TTC 500 is equipped with a Main CPU and a Safety Companion acting as external watchdog. For a detailed I/O description, characteristics and maximum ratings refer to the HYâTTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM], Part I: Hardware Description.

- **Bootloader:** The bootloader will be executed after reset, performing application software download, checking and starting the application software.

- **Board support package (BSP):** Start-up code for the Main CPU that needs to be linked to the application software and linker command files (containing addresses and size of RAM, Flash and stack area).

- **FPGA bitstream:** The HY-TTC 500 features an additional logic IC that is used for obtaining certain feedback values of safety-critical outputs. The FPGA's function can be updated by flashing a separate FPGA bitstream to the ECU. This bitstream is part of the HY-TTC 500 platform's software release package.

- **I/O driver library:** The I/O drivers are delivered to the system integrator in form of a C library and header files. The I/O drivers include: o software functions allowing to access the HY-TTC 500 interfaces and I/Os from the application software (e.g. controlling the PWM outputs, reading the analog inputs, communicating over the CAN interface)
o diagnostic modules that perform various I/O and CPU-internal tests at start-up and at runtime 
(e.g. RAM-tests, short circuit tests).

The interface between the application software and the HYâTTC 500 safety platform is the I/O driver API 
as specified by the HY-TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM], Part II: Software Description.

Category: Requirement Label: 3rd-Party_SW ID: 586813 Related To: Related To':
Other software modules (e.g. additional libraries for CANopen Safety protocol implementations or CODESYS runtimes) are not part of the HY-TTC 500 safety platform. Therefore, if such modules are used with safety-critical applications, these modules **shall** either be classified as 'proven in use' according to the requirements of IEC 61508 [IEC 61508], ISO 25119 [ISO 25119] and ISO 13849 [ISO 13849] or verified and validated by the system integrator according to the requirements of the associated performance level. This verification and validation also applies to generated C or object code by tools used during application development.

Category: Requirement Label: HW_Modification ID: 586815 Related To: 283996 Related To':
The HY-TTC 500 electronics **shall** not be modified in any part by the system integrator if used for safetycritical applications.

Category: Requirement Label: ID: 924760 Related To: Related To':

The HY-TTC 500 platform's I/Os **shall** only be used according to the characteristics and maximum ratings specified in the HY-TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM], Part I: Hardware Description.

## - - - - 3.1 Safety Parameters - 3.1.1 Safety Function

Category: Comment ID: 587503 The following safety function is performed by the HY-TTC 500: Execution of the user-programmed application (i.e. control the outputs in accordance with the control function and the input values) in a fail-safe principle.

## 3.1.2 Definition Of The Safe State

Category: Comment ID: 586823 In the safe state, no current will be applied to the safety-critical outputs of the ECU, i.e. in case of an error the safety-critical outputs will be switched off. One has to keep in mind, however, that the outputs are equipped with pull-up resistors to 5 V for diagnostic reasons. As this pull-up characteristic will not be disabled in the safe state, a minimal diagnostic current may flow through connected loads even in the safe state. The typical diagnostic currents are specified in the corresponding output's section within the HY-TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM], Part I: Hardware Description.

Category: Comment ID: 1194971 For diagnostic reasons, the ECU's sensor supply outputs are not automatically switched off when entering the safe state. It is therefore not recommended to use the sensor supply outputs as a power source that should be disabled immediately, in case of a safe state transition.

Category: Comment ID: 587485 For diagnostic reasons, a minimum duty cycle is always applied to the safety-critical PWM stages as long as the CPU is in the state *Main*. This is the case, even if the application deliberately deactivates the corresponding outputs. For details see section *PWM High Side Stages*.

Category: Comment ID: 590202 The HY-TTC 500 platform's PWM stages are allocated to three different shut-off groups that feature separate shut-off paths, each. Thusâin case of certain failuresâthe application software can deenergize the one group with the erroneous PWM output, while keeping the remaining two groups operational. That way, the system integrator may implement a limp-home function which allows the system to run in a reduced mode, e.g. for returning to the workshop for repair.

Category: Requirement Label: Shutoff_Allocation ID: 590192 Related To: 320067 Related To':
If the system integrator independently controls the separate shut-off groups in case of failures, the actuators **shall** be allocated to the groups in such a way that does not introduce dangerous situations in reduced operation mode.

## 3.1.3 Safety-Critical System Components

Category: Comment ID: 590198 A safety-critical system component is a component that may cause hazardous conditions in case of a failure or malfunction. The following components of the HY-TTC 500 are defined as being safety-critical if any of the ECU's functions is used in a safety-critical application:

The system integrator **shall** perform an FMEA for the system components and derive a list of safetycritical I/Os for the system.

## - - - 3.1.4 Failure Reaction In Case Of Errors -

Category: Comment ID: 723213 The HY-TTC 500 platform distinguishes between different errors with regards to the momentary failure reaction. Depending on the type of error, the I/O-driver's diagnostic modules will initiate specific actions. The following section describes those types of errors and the according HY-TTC 500 platform's behavior. A detailed failure classification into the different error types can be found in the I/O driver API within the TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM], Part II: Software Development.

## 3.1.4.1 Fatal Errors

Category: Comment ID: 723224 An error is classified as being fatal, if a safe program execution is not possible anymore, regardless of the actual application. The following errors are characterized as being fatal:
- errors that are fatal in their consequence, so that an anti-glitch strategy is not feasible (e.g. RAM or register errors, safe state activation by the Safety Companion)
- temporary errors that persist over the anti-glitch time For fatal errors, the HY-TTC 500 platform's failure reaction is to enter the safe state immediately. If the according notification callback is configured, the application software will be notified by the I/O-driver diagnostics.

## - 3.1.4.2 Non-Fatal Error - - - -

Category: Comment ID: 723236 An error is classified as being non-fatal, if its occurrence does not prevent the safe program execution, per se. That may be because the error is clearly related to a contained subsystem of the ECU (e.g. an analog input stage) or the error is located outside of the ECU (e.g. an open circuit of a safety-critical actuator).

Non-fatal errors do not directly lead to the safe state. Instead, the I/O-driver diagnostics will execute the application-specific error callback, if it has been correctly passed during the driver initialization.

## 3.1.4.3 Temporary Errors

Category: Comment ID: 723232 An error is classified as being temporary, if it only persists over a time less than or equal to the specified glitch filter time. Also, only those errors that feature dynamic characteristics may fall into the category of temporary errors, e.g. a signal range violation of an analog input signal or an invalid readback voltage of a digital power stage. In case a temporary error persists over the defined glitch filter time, it may either turn into a fatal error or a non-fatal error, according to its consequence.

## 3.1.5 Failure Reaction Time

Category: Comment ID: 609583 The driver's task begin and task end functions will service the windowed-watchdog.

Category: Comment ID: 587495 Several diagnostics performed by the HY-TTC 500 platform are executed periodically. With every call to IO_Driver_TaskEnd() the diagnostic task function is executed, performing the I/O driver's diagnostic measures, while the call to *IO_Driver_TaskBegin()* will service the external window watchdog.

The diagnostic state machine distributes the execution of all diagnostics among 6 consecutive cycles. An individual diagnostic measure is therefore performed every 6 application cycles.

Category: Comment ID: 722729 If feasible, a failing diagnostic check will be de-glitched for a certain amount of time (i.e. the so-called glitch filter time that can be configured by the system integrator) in order to prevent sporadic external interferences from directly leading to the system's safe state.

-

-

-

-

-

-

When selecting the application software's glitch filter time, the system integrator should account for all those failures that may occur only temporary. For example, a low battery voltage situation caused by cold-start cranking may lead to an invalid sensor supply voltage. However, only violations that do last longer than the specified glitch filter time will signal a persistent error. For details, refer to section *Failure* Reaction in Case of *Errors.*
Category: Requirement Label: Nonstop_Operation ID: 587497 Related To: 630889 Related To':
Because some diagnosticsâperformed by the HY-TTC 500âare only executed at system start-up, the application software **shall** not keep the ECU in a nonstop operation.

Category: Comment ID: 1194468 Details about the HY-TTC 500 platform's power functions can be found in chapter "*Power Supply*".

Category: Requirement Label: Driving_Cycle ID: 587499 Related To: 320113 Related To':
A typical driving cycle (i.e. the time between power-up and power-down of the ECU) **shall** not exceed 24 hours.

Category: Comment ID: 586825 The term 'typical driving cycle' describes the time interval between power-up and power-down, a vehicle is designed for. That means, driving cycles of more than 24 hours shall only happen on rare occasions and are to be exercised with the utmost caution, as the safety related tests performed upon start-up are no longer executed with the specified proof test interval.

Due to the fact, that a number of diagnostics is only performed during system start-up, the typical driving cycle is considered to be equal to the proof test interval.

Category: Requirement Label: Failure_Reaction_Time ID: 813086 Related To: Related To':
The system integrator **shall** consider the HY-TTC 500 platform's effective failure reaction time for each safety function.

Category: Comment ID: 813084 For calculating the worst case failure reaction time, the system integrator has to combine the core diagnostic's failure reaction time (being independent from the used I/Os) and the additional I/O related failure reaction time (taking into account the I/O specific diagnostic time delay). That way, the overall failure reaction time can be determined accurately, for each individual safety function.

## - 3.1.5.1 Core Failure Reaction Time - -

Category: Comment ID: 813067 The effective reaction time of the core's diagnostics is based on the following parameters that can be adjusted during the I/O driver initialization call:
- Command period, i.e. the so-called cycle time (*t_cycle*): 1 â¦ 50 ms
- Glitch filter time (*t_glitch*): 1 â¦ 180 ms In addition, the external watchdog window time (*t_wd*) is defined to be 64 ms.

The configured glitch filter time correlates with the selected cycle time. Each specific failure diagnostic will be executed every sixth application cycle. Under worst case conditions, the applied glitch filter time will therefore increase to the next higher integer multiple of 6 * t_cycle.

t_glitch_effective = round_to_multiple(t_glitch, 6*t_cycle)
Subsequently, the calculation of the core's effective worst case failure reaction time is as follows: wc_frt_core = max(((6+1) * t_cycle) + t_glitch_effective, t_wd) 
As a result, the core's calculated worst case failure reaction time can lie between 64 ms and 650 ms according to the safety parameters chosen by the application software.

## 3.1.5.2 I/O Failure Reaction Time

Category: Comment ID: 813423 Specific properties of the input and output stages (and their related signals) might contribute to the overall worst case failure reaction time for a given safety function, as well.

For the overall worst case failure reaction time, the system integrator typically has to add up the worst case failure reaction times of the core and the worst case failure reaction time for the input and output stages (i.e. the single input or output stage type that has the greatest influence).

The following section will outline the detailed impact of every I/O type.

## 3.1.5.2.1 Pwm High Side Outputs

Category: Comment ID: 813082 Due to the PWM signal's nature, the configured PWM frequency is directly related to the worst case failure reaction time. The effective increase of the core's failure reaction time is twice the PWM output period plus an additional application cycle.

wc_frt_io = 2 * pwm_period + t_cycle Category: Comment ID: 813449 In case the PWM high side current measurement is considered safety-relevant, the effective increase of the core's failure reaction time is 20 ms plus an additional application cycle.

wc_frt_io = 20 *ms + t_cycle*

## - - 3.1.5.2.2 Digital High Side Outputs - - -

Category: Comment ID: 813461 The digital high side output increases the core's failure reaction time by 20 ms. wc_frt_io = 20 ms

## 3.1.5.2.3 Timer Inputs

Category: Comment ID: 813466 Due to the timer signal's nature, the configured timer frequency is directly related to the worst case failure reaction time. The effective increase of the core's failure reaction time is equal to the inverse of the specified lower frequency threshold.

wc_frt_io = timer_period

## 3.1.5.2.4 Analog Inputs

Category: Comment ID: 813469 The analog inputs provide instant diagnostics that do not further increase the core's failure reaction time. 

Therefore, they do feature a failure reaction time of 0 ms.

wc_frt_io = 0 ms

## 3.1.5.2.5 External Shut-Off Inputs

Category: Comment ID: 969439 The worst case reaction time for shutting off the corresponding safety switch groups via the external shutoff inputs is only dependent on the particular application cycle time. These analog shut-off inputs are sampled every 6th application cycle and the shut-off groups will be deactivated within the next application cycle or within 5 ms - whichever occurs first. wc_frt_extshutoff = (6 * t_cycle) + min(t_cycle; 5 ms)
Note: This formula assumes an ideal switch without bouncing and simultaneous switching times for both terminals. Depending on the chosen switch, further timing delays have to be considered.

## - 3.1.5.3 Calculation Examples -

Category: Comment ID: 719711 The following examples will outline the procedure for calculating the worst case failure reaction time for given sets of inputs and outputs together with assumed cycle time (*t_cycle*) and glitch filter time (*t_glitch*).

## Category: Comment Id: 813591 Example 1:

An application software specifies the cycle time (*t_cycle*) to be 10 ms and the glitch filter time (*t_glitch*) to be 100 ms. A given safety function makes use of the following safety-related inputs and outputs: 
- 3 PWM high side outputs configured with an output frequency of 250 Hz 
- 2 digital high side outputs - 2 timer inputs being used with a frequency of 2 kHz, each 
- 2 timer inputs being used with a frequency of 100 Hz, each The resulting worst case failure reaction time of the core can be calculated as follows:
t_glitch_effective = round_to_multiple(100 ms, 6*10 ms) = 120 ms Note: *round_to_multiple* means to find a positive integer number n that fulfills *n*6*t_cycle >= t_glitch*. In this example n must be 2 which results in *2*6*10ms = 120ms*. wc_frt_core = max(((6+1) * 10 ms) + 120 ms, 64 ms) = 190 ms The additional failure reaction time caused by the PWM high side outputs is: wc_frt_io_pwm = 2 * 4 ms + 10 ms = 18 ms The additional failure reaction time caused by the digital high side outputs is: wc_frt_io_dout = 20 ms The additional failure reaction time caused by the 2 timer inputs with a frequency of 2 kHz is:
wc_frt_io_timer2kHz = 0.5 ms The additional failure reaction time caused by the 2 timer inputs with a frequency of 100 Hz is:
wc_frt_io_timer100Hz = 10 ms For the overall worst case calculation, the I/O type with the greatest influence, i.e. the digital high side outputs, will be used: wc_frt_io = wc_frt_io_dout = *20 ms* The overall failure reaction time for this exemplary configuration of the HY-TTC 500 platform is therefore:
wc_frt = wc_frt_core + wc_frt_io = 190 ms + 20 ms = 210 ms That means, the assumed diagnostic coverage for the I/O driver's core diagnostics is only valid for safety functions with a process safety time of 210 ms or higher. For those safety functions that require a shorter failure reaction time, the system integrator needs to either adapt the above-mentioned parameters or provide separate diagnostic measures within the application software.

Category: Comment ID: 813743

## Example 2: -

An application software specifies the cycle time (*t_cycle*) to be 1 ms and the glitch filter time (*t_glitch*) to be 180 ms. A given safety function makes use of the following safety-related inputs and outputs: 
- 2 PWM high side outputs configured with an output frequency of 500 Hz and safety-relevant current measurement
- 2 timer inputs being used with a frequency of 10 Hz, each 
- 4 analog inputs The resulting worst case failure reaction time of the core can be calculated as follows: t_glitch_effective = round_to_multiple(180 ms, 6*1 ms) = 180 ms Note: *round_to_multiple* means to find a positive integer number n that fulfills *n*6*t_cycle >= t_glitch*. In this example n must be 30 which results in *30*6*10ms = 180ms*.

wc_frt_core = max(((6+1) * 1 ms) + 180 ms, 64 ms) = 187 ms The additional failure reaction time caused by the PWM high side outputs is: wc_frt_io_pwm = 2 * 2 ms + 1 ms = 5 ms The additional failure reaction time caused by the PWM high side current measurement is:
wc_frt_io_current = 20 ms + 1 ms = 21 ms The additional failure reaction time caused by the 2 timer inputs with a frequency of 10 Hz is: wc_frt_io_timer = 100 ms The 4 analog inputs do not contribute to the overall failure rate, at all. wc_frt_io_analog = 0 ms For the overall worst case calculation, the I/O type with the greatest influence, i.e. the timer inputs, will be used:
wc_frt_io = wc_frt_io_timer = 100 ms The overall failure reaction time for this exemplary configuration of the HY-TTC 500 platform is therefore: wc_frt = wc_frt_core + wc_frt_io = 187 ms + 100 ms = 287 ms That means, the assumed diagnostic coverage for the I/O driver's core diagnostics is only valid for safety functions with a process safety time of 287 ms or higher. For those safety functions that require a shorter failure reaction time, the system integrator needs to either adapt the above-mentioned parameters or provide separate diagnostic measures within the application software.

## 3.1.6.1 Mission Profiles

Category: Comment ID: 591167 The hardware failure rate estimation has been performed based on two different assumed environmental conditions, in order to allow the system integrator to choose the mission profile that fits best to the overall system's mission profile. The both mission profiles differ in their typical usage characteristics: - The first mission profile (*MP_Conventional*) is targeted towards conventional off-highway vehicles, typically being operated continuously throughout the whole day with a relatively low number of operational cycles: o Number of working cycles per day: 5 o Average temperature variation seen by the ECU's components each working cycle: 35 Â°C o Average temperature variation seen by the ECU's components each non-operational day: 10 Â°C

-

-

-

- The second mission profile (*MP_Stop-Go*) considers the common usage characteristics of stop-&-go applications, with a high number of very short working tasks throughout the typical working day: o Number of working cycles per day: 100 o Average temperature variation seen by the ECU's components each working cycle: 5 Â°C o Average temperature variation seen by the ECU's components each non-operational day: 10 Â°C

| Ambient Temperature   | Distribution   |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| -40 Â°C                | 0.5 %          |
| 23 Â°C                 | 35 %           |

| Table 2 -             |                |

Both mission profiles are based on the worst-case assumption of 24 h of operational time per day and an average operational utilization of 300 days per year. In addition, the following ambient temperature distribution has been assumed:

## 4 Safety Measures Of The Hy-Ttc 500 Platform - - - -

Category: Comment ID: 591243 The following section outlines the diagnostics that are implemented by the HY-TTC 500 platform for the individual functional blocks. It also describes how these functions have to be configured by the system integrator for safe operation of the HY-TTC 500 platform.

Category: Comment ID: 1544257 Please consider, that requirements given for a pins alternative functions are also valid for HY-TTC 500 variants which just provide the alternative function functions (e.g. HY-TTC 540 - Pin 101 just provides 'Digital Input' / 'Timer Input' instead of the main function 'HS PWM Output' - nevertheless, the requirements stated in the 'PWM High Side Stages' section for alternative functions have to be considered as well).

## 4.1 Power Supply

Category: Comment ID: 591645 The HY-TTC 500 platform features two physically separated power supply connections. One power supply connection is exclusively provided for the ECU's logic unit, while the other connection supplies the power stages. In addition, the ECU is equipped with two additional inputs for a power control function: In permanently supplied systems, the terminal 15 input (K15) may be connected with the ignition key lock, the wake up input (Wake-Up) may be connected to a secondary power up source (e.g. the vehicle's door contact). The ECU's activation is triggered, in case one of these inputs is turned on. After deactivating these signals, the ECU may continue to operate before autonomously powering down upon the application's shutdown request. Details about the terminal 15 and wake up inputs can be found in the TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM]. In case the software-controlled shutdown function via terminal 15 is not utilized (i.e., terminal 15 is tied to battery voltage and the HY-TTC 500 platform's power supply is directly activated and deactivated by the operator), the system integrator is advised to provide the system operator with means to disconnect the ECU's logic unit from battery voltage. In order to allow reliable deactivationâeven in case of an external load being shorted to battery voltageâthe power switch (e.g. ignition key, circuit breaker â¦) is required to also disconnect the ECU's logic unit from the power stage supply rail.

Category: Requirement Label: Operator_Shutdown ID: 591647 Related To: 284257 Related To':
The operator **shall** be provided with means to disable the ECU's supply either by utilizing the HYTTC 500 platform's power control function or by directly disconnecting the ECU's logic supply from battery voltage.

Category: Requirement Label: Supply_Separation ID: 591649 Related To: 284257 Related To':
If the HY-TTC 500 platform's power control function is not utilized and both power supply rails are tied together, the system integrator **shall** assure that the power switchâdisconnecting the ECU's logic supplyâdoes also separate the logic supply from the power stage supply.

Category: Comment ID: 591651 The following figure shows an **invalid** wiring example when using a power switch without terminal 15 utilization. In case of external short circuits on the actuator lines, the internal logic core (BAT+ CPU) ![34_image_0.png]( The image displays a diagram with a red line through it that reads "INVALID." This could be an electrical or mechanical diagram, possibly related to power systems or other energy-related concepts. The red line is placed over several components of the diagram, indicating that they are not valid or should not be used in the context of the system being depicted.)

![34_image_1.png]( The image displays a diagram of an electrical circuit with a red sign stating "INVALID" placed over it. The circuit appears to be a complex network of wires and components, including batteries, switches, and other electronic devices. The presence of the "INVALID" sign suggests that this particular circuit is not functioning correctly or has been deemed unsafe for use.)

The following figure shows another **invalid** wiring example when using a power switch to concurrently disconnect terminal 15 and the supply for the internal power stages (BAT+ Power). In case of external short circuits in the actuator lines, the terminal 15 input might still be supplied via reverse conducting power stages, even if the power switch is activated.

## Figure 2

Category: Comment ID: 591653 The following figure shows a valid wiring example when using a power switch that independently disconnects the supply for the internal logic core (BAT+ CPU) and also decouples both power supply rails from each other. In case of external short circuits on the actuator lines, the power switch can still deenergize the ECU's logic core and therefore shut down the overall ECU. With this configuration however, a software-controlled after-run is not possible.

Category: Comment ID: 591655 The following figure shows another valid wiring example when using an power switch, only disconnecting the terminal 15 pin (K15).

Category: Requirement Label: Power_Override_K15 ID: 717653 Related To: 632325 Related To':
The application software **shall** not request a power-down of the ECU (by calling *IO_POWER_Set()*) while the voltage level of terminal 15 (K15) is still high.

Category: Comment ID: 717655 A power down request while terminal 15 (K15) is high will lead to a reset of the device, i.e., the device will immediately power on again. This procedure will also clear the count of safety-related resets which is typically only performed for safety-critical errors; the number of allowed resets is configured via the safety parameters of the general driver initialization function.

A shutdown is only to be performed if the voltage level of K15 is low. Notice that the HY-TTC 500 may not power down if K15 is high and the device is already in the safe state. This might be the case, if, e.g., the device has already performed the specified maximum number of allowed resets.

## - - 4.2 Input Stages - -

Category: Comment ID: 592155 The following section describes the requirements for utilization of input stages in safety-critical environments. Whenever a requirement demands the redundant usage of specific inputs, this redundancy does only correspond to the HY-TTC 500 input stage. The sensor, however, may feature a single channel architecture, as long as it is connected to both used inputs, in parallel. Still, the system integrator is responsible for calculating the overall dangerous failure rate of the complete channel involved in the execution of a safety function. The redundancy of input stages may also be established by combining different types of input stagesâas long as both of the utilized input types support the desired mode of operation.

## 4.2.1 Timer Inputs

Category: Comment ID: 592163 The digital timer inputs 0-5 (*IO_PWD_00* ... *IO_PWD_05*) provide the necessary diagnostic measures and are usable for safety-critical applications, when adhering to the requirements in the following section. The digital timer inputs 6-11 (*IO_PWD_06* ... *IO_PWD_11*) do not provide the same set of diagnostic measures and are therefore not usable for safety-critical applications without further restrictions. For details about their suitability, please refer to section *Guideline on Hardware Metrics Determination*.

Category: Requirement Label: Timer_Get ID: 592203 Related To: Related To':
For each safety-critical timer input stage, the application **shall** periodically trigger the measurement of pulse high-time, pulse low-time, period width, frequency or number of edges for pulsed sensor signals via the appropriate driver functions:
- *IO_PWD_ComplexGet()* - *IO_PWD_IncGet()* - *IO_PWD_CountGet()* 
- *IO_PWD_UniversalGet()* - *IO_PWD_GetCurrent()* Note 1: If a universal timer channel is co-configured for incremental mode together with any other combination of modes both the primary and secondary channel are redundantly configured. Thus, for safety-critical configuration, the application software needs to periodically trigger the measurement for both channels of complex or edge count modes. Note 2: If a complex timer channel is configured as safety-critical current timer input (parameter *pupd =* 
IO_PWD_PD_90) the current measurement function *IO_PWD_GetCurrent()* needs to be called alongside one of the four remaining timer step functions.

## - 4.3 Power Stages - - - -

Category: Comment ID: 591657 The HY-TTC 500 platform is capable of controlling safety-critical actuators with either PWM high side outputs or a combination of digital high side and low side stages. The following section will outline the considerations that have to be taken into account during system integration.

## 4.3.1 Pwm High Side Stages

Category: Comment ID: 592276 The PWM high side stages (*IO_PWM_00* ... *IO_PWM_35*) provide the necessary diagnostic measures and are usable for safety-critical applications, when adhering to the subsequent requirements. Every PWM high side stage also provides a dedicated current measurement function that can also be utilized for safety-critical functions, if required for a given system.

Category: Comment ID: 592272 Typically, the PWM high side stages of the HY-TTC 500 platform will be used for controlling valves. For a safe operation of these valves, the safety platform monitors the duty cycle and frequency of the PWM signals, at runtime. In addition, the outputs are checked for short circuits to ground or power supply as well as for open circuits (e.g. cable break).

In order to perform these diagnostics, the PWM signal's nature of having steadily changing voltage levels is used for comparing the desired signal sequence with the actual measurement. As a result, the minimum and maximum duty cycles are limited, so that a test pulse for diagnostic measurements is present under all conditions which can be used for continuously testing the ability to deactivate the power stages.

The duty cycle limits and duty cycle tolerances are defined in the I/O driver. Depending on the initial I/O driver configuration, the HY-TTC 500 will either directly enter the safe state or leave the decision to the application software via the optional error callback (see section *Application Callbacks*).

Category: Requirement Label: PWM_Minimum_Energy ID: 592111 Related To: Related To':
The system integrator **shall** ensure that the PWM stage's lower duty cycle limit (i.e. the minimum possible duty cycle) does not already energize the connected actuator in a way that could lead to a dangerous situation.

Category: Comment ID: 919117 The minimum possible duty cycle results from the minimum pulse length (100 Âµs) that is present even if the application software deactivates a safety-critical high side stage. Depending on the configured PWM frequency, the minimum duty cycle might go up to a value of 10 %, i.e. for a PWM frequency of 1000 Hz.

Category: Comment ID: 592687 If the application tries to initialize a PWM stage with a frequency which is not supported by the HY-TTC 500, the I/O driver will use the next higher available frequency. For the list of available frequencies refer to the HY-TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM], Part II: Software Description.

Category: Comment ID: 592689 Note that for frequencies which do not result in a period of an integral multiple of 1 ms, the I/O driver only provides averaged values calculated over 2 or 4 PWM periods, as stated in the HY-TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM], Part II: Software Description.

Category: Comment ID: 843350 Every PWM high side stage features an internal secondary shut-off path, the so-called safety switch. 

Depending on the device variant, up to three separate safety switches are available, each one allocated to a predefined group of PWM high side stages. Details of the safety switch allocation can be found in the HYâTTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM].

Due to the PWM high side stages' reverse conducting characteristics, a short circuit to battery voltage at any PWM high side output's connector pinâeven those not being used for safety-critical applicationsmight influence the safety integrity of all remaining high side stages sharing the same safety switch, by preventing that single safety switch from de-energizing. To that end, the system integrator is advised to evaluate the criticality of such failures when allocating the HY-TTC 500 platform's connector pins to the system's safety functions.

Category: Requirement Label: PWMHS_Short_Group ID: 843420 Related To: Related To':
The system integrator **shall** take into account the possibility of an external short circuit to battery voltage at a PWM high side stage's connector pin and consider the impact on those PWM high side stages sharing the same internal safety switch.

Category: Comment ID: 843422 These considerations are also relevant when using the PWM high side stages' secondary functions, i.e. the digital or frequency input capabilities. 

Category: Comment ID: 592695 If the application software initializes PWM stages by passing safety parameters, the I/O driver checks the specified PWM frequency and returns an error if the valid range is violated.

Category: Requirement Label: PWMHS_Set ID: 592699 Related To: Related To':
For each safety-critical PWM output, the application **shall** periodically call the PWM high side stage's appropriate task function *IO_PWM_SetDuty()* to trigger the feedback measurements.

If the current measurement of a safety-critical PWM output is also considered safety-critical, the application software **shall** periodically call the PWM high side stage's appropriate task function IO_PWM_GetCur() or *IO_PWM_GetCurQueue()* to trigger the current measurements.

Category: Requirement Label: PWMHS_Resolve ID: 1195152 Related To: Related To':
When using the PWM ouput's resolve function to distinguish between open loads and battery short circuits, i.e. *IO_PWM_ResolveOpenLoadShortCircuit()*, the system integrator **shall** consider the impact on all remaining PWM output pins (*IO_PWM_00* ... *IO_PWM_35*).

Category: Comment ID: 1195168 Details about the PWM output's resolve function can be found in the HY-TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM], Part II: Software Description.

Category: Requirement Label: PWMHS_Metrics ID: 920124 Related To: Related To':
The probabilistic values for the PWM high side stages **shall** be chosen in accordance with section Guideline on Hardware Metrics Determination.

Category: Requirement Label: PWMHS_Alternative_Group ID: 843776 Related To: Related To':
When utilizing the secondary function inputs of PWM high side stages, sharing a safety switch with safety-related PWM high side stages, the system integrator **shall** employ input devices (i.e. sensors and switches) whose failure modes do not violate the overall system's safety functions.

Category: Comment ID: 844022 That would be, e.g. the avoidance of sensors with push pull stages or switches to battery voltage, excluding the possibility of dangerously influencing the remaining PWM high side stages.

## 4.3.2 Digital High Side Stages - - - - - -

Category: Comment ID: 592286 The digital high side stages (*IO_DO_00* ... *IO_DO_07*) provide the necessary diagnostic measures and are usable for safety-critical applications, when adhering to the subsequent requirements.

Category: Comment ID: 717651 Typically, the digital high side outputs of the HY-TTC 500 platform will be used for controlling valves. For a safe operation of these valves, the safety platform monitors the output level of the digital output signals, at runtime. In addition, the outputs are checked for short circuits to ground or power supply as well as for open circuits (e.g. cable break).

Depending on the initial I/O driver configuration, the HY-TTC 500 will either directly enter the safe state or leave the decision to the application software via the optional error callback (see section *Application* Callbacks).

Category: Requirement Label: DigitalHS_Voltage ID: 592655 Related To: Related To':
For each safety-critical digital high side output, the application **shall** periodically call the digital high side stage's appropriate task function *IO_DO_Set()* to trigger the feedback measurements.

Category: Comment ID: 591251 The measurement values required for diagnostics will be checked internally by the diagnostic module of the I/O driver. The system integrator has to take care of correctly setting up the safety-critical outputs during initialization and periodically calling the output's step functions (e.g. *IO_DO_Set()*) with a cycle time that is appropriate for the diagnostic purpose of the overall system.

Category: Requirement Label: DigitalHS_ShutOff ID: 592274 Related To: Related To':
When operating digital high side outputs in a safety-critical manner, the system integrator **shall** utilize low side stages as secondary shut-off paths or provide other means that allow to redundantly disable the connected actuators.

Category: Requirement Label: DigitalHS_Init ID: 592331 Related To: 648174 Related To':
When utilizing the low side stages as secondary shut-off paths, the application software **shall** specify the shut-off path configuration used for each safety-critical digital output when calling the digital output driver initialization function *IO_DO_Init()*.

Related To: Related To':
When operating digital high side outputs in a safety-critical manner and changing the output's state with periods shorter than the HY-TTC 500 platform's overall worst case failure reaction time, the application software **shall** periodically evaluate the return value of the task function *IO_DO_Set()* in order to check for dangerous failures.

Category: Comment ID: 814594 In case of such frequent state changes by the application software via *IO_DO_Set()*, the HYTTC 500 platform's glitch filter strategy might cover potential failures of the corresponding digital output 
(e.g. an external short circuit to battery voltage). These error conditions will however be passed to the application via the *IO_DO_Set()* return value, even if a certain failure is currently being de-glitched. Therefore, the system integrator is advised to frequently check the task function's return value for error conditions that may prove to be dangerous according to the overall system concept.

Category: Comment ID: 814943 Periodically changing a digital high side output's state even faster (i.e. with a period shorter than 20 ms) will completely prevent the HY-TTC 500 diagnostics from reading correct feedback values, anymore. This will result in a persistent error condition that executes the application software's error callback function.

Category: Comment ID: 814673 For operating high side outputs with periodically changing states and a period shorter than the HYTTC 500 platform's overall worst case failure reaction time, the system integrator should utilize the dedicated PWM high side outputs. These outputs provide superior diagnostic measures for detecting failures within dynamically changing output signals.

If demanded by the system's design, the application software **shall** use the Memory Protection Unit (MPU) to protect critical memory areas from unpermitted access.

Category: Comment ID: 4106003 The following section is only applicable if the system integrator uses the memory protection unit Category: Comment ID: 4105505 If the MPU is used, the I/O Driver source code needs to execute in privileged CPU mode.

Category: Comment ID: 718479 If the MPU is not used at all, the entire CPU internal memories need to be considered as "safe" areas.

If the MPU is used, the I/O Driver code needs read and write permissions for the following RAM memory sections:
- CSM_VAR_ZERO_INIT_UNSPECIFIED, CSM_VAR_NO_INIT_UNSPECIFIED
- IO_DRIVER_DATA_NORMAL - IO_DRIVER_COMMON
- Shared Memory area (0x0803FEE0 to 0x0803FFFF)
Category: Comment ID: 4106230 If the MPU is used, the I/O Driver code needs read and executable permissions for the following internal flash memory section: - CSM_CODE

Category: Comment ID: 4106267 If the MPU is used, the I/O Driver code needs at least read permissions for the following internal flash memory sections:
- CSM_CONST
- IO_DRIVER_CONST
Category: Comment ID: 4106271 The I/O Driver code executes in the main application thread and in exceptions. Requirements for the MPU access permissions have to be fulfilled in both cases: - In the main thread, the application enables and disables the User MPU regions using the IO_MPU 
API functions as needed to comply with the I/O Driver requirements and with the safety requirements specific to the application. E.g. when a User MPU region is configured to deny access to one of the I/O Driver memory sections, this region must be disabled from the API before any I/O Driver function can be called.

- The behavior in exceptions depends on the selected MPU protection policy as configured in the IO_MPU API. Depending on the setting, the I/O Driver automatically disables selected User MPU 
regions in order to ensure the necessary access permissions.

Category: Comment ID: 4106341 The system needs at least read access permissions to the VIM (Vector Interrupt Manager) peripheral memory area (0xFFFFFE00 to 0xFFFFFEFF), if the MPU is used.

## - - - - - 5.4 Failure Diagnostics

Category: Comment ID: 592663 Those consistency checks for safety-critical system components that will be implemented by the application software have to be executed with a periodicity that correlates with the overall system's process safety time. The worst case failure reaction time has to be calculated with respect to the overall application parameters, similar to the algorithm in section *Failure Reaction Time*.

The effective reaction time is based on the following parameters:
- The maximum cycle time (*t_cycle*) that is defined during the I/O driver initialization call
- The interval between the execution of the consistency check (*n_rounds_check*) in software cycles
- The external watchdog window time (*t_wd*) that is defined to be 64 ms. The calculation of the effective worst case failure reaction time is as follows: wc_frt = *max(t_cycle * (n_rounds_check + 1), t_wd)*
Compliance with the system's failure reaction time has been assumed during the HY-TTC 500 platform's FMEDA. Consequently, the effective diagnostic coverage for the relevant system components is only valid, if the application software's consistency checks are executed with an adequate frequency.

-

Category: Comment ID: 717254 The following example outlines the procedure for calculating the worst case failure reaction time for a user application that utilizes redundant timer inputs with an assumed cycle time (*t_cycle*) of 10 ms and a consistency check for the redundant inputs that is executed every fourth application cycle 
(*n_rounds_check*).

-

-

-

-

-
The resulting worst case failure reaction time is: wc_frt = max(10 ms * (4 + 1), 64 ms) *= 64 ms* That means, the assumed diagnostic coverage for the timer input's safety mechanism (*redundancy*) is only valid for safety functions with a process safety time of 64 ms or higher. For those safety functions that require a shorter failure reaction time, the system integrator needs to either adapt the abovementioned parameters or provide separate diagnostic measures within the application software.

Category: Requirement Label: IO_Deglitching ID: 717264 Related To: 320033 Related To':
The application **shall** adequately debounce glitches originating from EMI or other disturbances for all safety-critical I/Os. The HY-TTC 500 platform will only filter glitches for the platform's internal diagnostic measures to prevent inadvertent activation of the safe state, but will not filter the sensor values for the application.

Category: Requirement Label: Data_Protection ID: 717266 Related To: 631193,686246 Related To':
The application **shall** provide the appropriate protection for safety-critical data that is stored to the ECU's non-volatile memory (e.g. CRC protection or redundant data storage).

## - - - - 5.5 Safe State - - 5.5.1 Application Callbacks

Category: Comment ID: 723615 The HY-TTC 500 I/O driver provides 2 application callbacks, which can be configured when calling the general driver initialization function *IO_Driver_Init()*.

The callbacks are executed depending on the error type before the safe state is entered:
- Error callback - executed for *non-fatal* errors - Notification callback - executed for *fatal* errors Category: Comment ID: 723687 Within the error callback function, the application software can decide which action shall be taken (e.g. disable a PWM shut-off group).

Within the notification callback function, the application software could notify other controllers (e.g. in a CAN network), that a fatal error occurred and, if configured, a reset of the ECU will take place.

Category: Requirement Label: Error_Callback_Action ID: 723747 Related To: Related To':
If demanded by the system's design, the application software **shall** define an error callback function, returning an action for each failure of the safety-critical I/O's being part of a safety function.

Category: Requirement Label: Error_Callback_LS ID: 969456 Related To: Related To':
An error callback for a high side digital output or a PWM high side stage **shall** be treated with the same severity as an error on the corresponding low side safety switch.

Category: Requirement Label: Error_Callback_Timing ID: 590305 Related To: 626937 Related To':
The application software's error callback function **shall** not introduce any significant delay when deciding the action to take, i.e. the error callback function must only contain basic statements for deciding which action to take. An acceptable upper limit for the execution of the callback function is 1 ms. This assures that the device's failure reaction time is not increased by the implementation of the callback function.

Category: Comment ID: 590311 The notification callback has no such limitation as the safe state is activated before this callback is called. It is still recommended to keep the notification callback function short because most interrupts 
(depending on the error) are disabled during its execution.

Category: Requirement Label: IO_Callback ID: 609585 Related To: Related To':
The application software **shall** not perform any I/O handling in the error callback or notification callback function with exception of the following functions:
- *IO_RTC_GetDateAndTimeStatus*
- *IO_RTC_GetDateAndTime*
- *IO_EEPROM_GetStatus*
- *IO_EEPROM_Read*
- *IO_EEPROM_Write* Category: Requirement Label: Error_Diagnostics ID: 609587 Related To: 626893 Related To':
Upon activation of the safe state, the application software **shall** save the error code that has caused the safe state in a non-volatile failure memory, e.g. the EEPROM.

Category: Requirement Label: Startup_Failure_Memory ID: 717487 Related To: 626899 Related To':
Upon start-up, the application software **shall** check the failure memory's last entries and instruct the Main CPU to enter the safe state, if the last entries show fatal errors that might prevent a safe system operation, e.g. a failing Main CPU, watchdog or voltage monitor.

Category: Requirement Label: Startup_Safety_Switch ID: 808049 Related To: 706225 Related To':
If the application software's error callback is executed due to a failing safety switch startup test (i.e. error code *DIAG_E_SSW_TEST*), the application software **shall** define an action to be taken according to the overall system design.

Category: Comment ID: 808085 In case of a failing safety switch startup test that cannot be traced back to an isolated failure of an associated PWM high side stage, the complete safety switch group might be impaired. The system integrator is therefore advised to immediately disable the affected safety switch and all connected PWM high side stages.

A defective safety switchâacting as secondary shut-off path of a safety-related PWM high side stageâis considered dangerous and does therefore not allow further operation of the affected PWM high side stages.

Category: Requirement Label: Runtime_Safety_Switch ID: 808047 Related To: 541719 Related To':
If the application software's error callback is executed due to a failing safety switch test during runtime (i.e. error code *DIAG_E_SSW_PERIODIC*), the application software **shall** define an action to be taken according to the overall system design.

Category: Comment ID: 808549 In case of a failing safety switch runtime test, the ECU might sustain permanent damage due to internal over-heating. The system integrator is therefore advised to immediately disable the affected safety switch and all connected PWM high side stages.

## 8.1 Mttfd Values Of Functional Blocks

Category: Comment ID: 919710 Based on the specific failure modes of the HY-TTC 500 platform's hardware parts, a detailed FMEDA has been conducted. The following section lists the obtained MTTFd values for every functional block according to the two exemplary mission profiles (see section *Mission Profiles*). These values are also available as a dedicated library for usage within the SISTEMA software utility. 

The listed MTTFd values are directly related to the main connector's pins, regardless of their configured functions. That means, the dangerous failure rate does not change, ifâfor exampleâa dedicated output pin is configured to be used as an analog input, or a dedicated analog input is configured to be used as a digital input.

Note 1: The item *Core* contains the HY-TTC 500 platform's integral logic components (e.g. internal power supply or Main CPU) and is vital to the ECU's general function. Therefore, its failure rate has to be added to every individual safety function, regardless of the utilized set of functional blocks.

Note 2: The item Transient *Core Failures* includes the Main CPU's soft errors. These failures are typically only applicable to metrics calculations based on IEC 61508.

Category: Comment ID: 3276672 The following table covers all those functional blocks for which the HY-TTC 508 ECU does not provide any diagnostic measures. However, the system integrator may implement measures against dangerous failures on system level. To that end, every block's overall failure rate is assumed to be evenly distributed between safe and dangerous failures according to the general approach in ISO 13849, i.e. MTTFd = 2 * MTTF.

The diagnostic measures and the determination of their diagnostic coverage is in the responsibility of the system integrator. Therefore, no detailed guideline can be given here.

Note 1: The item *Core* contains the HY-TTC 500 platform's integral logic components (e.g. internal power supply or Main CPU) and is vital to the ECU's general function. Therefore, its failure rate has to be added to every individual safety function, regardless of the utilized set of functional blocks. Note 2: The item *Transient Core Failures* includes the Main CPU's soft errors. These failures are typically only applicable to metrics calculations based on IEC 61508.

Category: Comment ID: 1534879 The following table covers all those functional blocks for which the HY-TTC 510 ECU does not provide any diagnostic measures. However, the system integrator may implement measures against dangerous failures on system level. To that end, every block's overall failure rate is assumed to be evenly distributed between safe and dangerous failures a ccording to the general approach in ISO 13849, i.e. MTTFd = 2 * MTTF.

The diagnostic measures and the determination of their diagnostic coverage is in the responsibility of the system integrator. Therefore, no detailed guideline can be given here.

Note 1: The item *Core* contains the HY-TTC 500 platform's integral logic components (e.g. internal power supply or Main CPU) and is vital to the ECU's general function. Therefore, its failure rate has to be added to every individual safety function, regardless of the utilized set of functional blocks.

Note 2: The item *Transient Core Failures* includes the Main CPU's soft errors. These failures are typically only applicable to metrics calculations based on IEC 61508.

Category: Comment ID: 1534871 The following table covers all those functional blocks for which the HY-TTC 540 platform does not provide any diagnostic measures. However, the system integrator may implement measures against dangerous failures on system level. To that end, every block's overall failure rate is assumed to be evenly distributed between safe and dangerous failures according to the general approach in ISO 13849, i.e. MTTFd = 2 * MTTF.

The diagnostic measures and the determination of their diagnostic coverage is in the responsibility of the system integrator. Therefore, no detailed guideline can be given here.

## Table 19 -

Note 1: The item *Core* contains the HY-TTC 500 platform's integral logic components (e.g. internal power supply or Main CPU) and is vital to the ECU's general function. Therefore, its failure rate has to be added to every individual safety function, regardless of the utilized set of functional blocks. Note 2: The item *Transient Core Failures* includes the Main CPU's soft errors. These failures are typically only applicable to metrics calculations based on IEC 61508.

Category: Comment ID: 3276666 The following table covers all those functional blocks for which the HY-TTC 590/590E platform does not provide any diagnostic measures. However, the system integrator may implement measures against dangerous failures on system level. To that end, every block's overall failure rate is assumed to be evenly distributed between safe and dangerous failures according to the general approach in ISO 13849, i.e. MTTFd = 2 * MTTF. The diagnostic measures and the determination of their diagnostic coverage is in the responsibility of the system integrator. Therefore, no detailed guideline can be given here.

## 8.2 Failure Diagnostics

Category: Comment ID: 920153 In order to detect dangerous hardware failures within the HY-TTC 500 platform, certain diagnostic measures are in place. Some of these measures will be permanently enabled regardless of the application software, while others depend on the system integrator's implementation on system level. The following section will give a guideline on choosing an appropriate set of measures according to the desired value of diagnostic coverage for each individual functional block. In general, these measures are intended to detect hardware failures inside the HY-TTC 500 platform. Depending on the used components (i.e. switches, sensors or actuators), the measures might, however, also contribute to the detection of external failures. 

The selection of appropriate diagnostic measures requires the system integrator to regard the input elements' individual characteristics (i.e. possible signal ranges, failure modes, architectural parameters). 

Therefore, the following list of diagnostic measures is only considered a general guideline without claiming complete validity. It is the responsibility of the system integrator to perform a hazard and risk analysis for the overall system, to select suitable measures against dangerous failures of individual components and to identify the actual diagnostic coverage that can be claimed for a specific diagnostic measure.

Note: If the overall system architecture permits the usage of functional structures without diagnostic coverage (e.g. for a system with a category B architecture according to ISO 13849) the implementation of these failure diagnostics might not be required. It may be sufficient to rely on the function blocks' MTTFd values, as outlined in section *MTTFd Values of Functional Blocks*. Either way, TTControl suggests to implement an appropriate set of failure diagnostics, regardless of the system's architectural demands, in order to achieve the best possible safety performance.

## - 8.2.1 Combined Safety Mechanisms -

Category: Comment ID: 958838 When combining safety mechanisms that supplement each other in terms of their diagnostic capabilities, the overall diagnostic coverage is assumed to be higher than the value of every single mechanisms. The above-listed table makes use of that principle and therefore suggests, to some extent, slightly higher DC 
values for combined safety mechanisms.

## 8.2.2 Core

Category: Comment ID: 894365 If the application software passes a safety configuration to the general driver initialization function, the core's diagnostic functions are implicitly executed during runtime and cannot be disabled by the application software. Therefore, the diagnostic coverage to be used for the core is an average value based on several diagnostic measures. Detected failures within the HY-TTC 500 platform's core will directly lead to the safe state and trigger the according notification callback.

Also, if the system requires any kind of diagnostic coverage for one or more input or output stages (i.e. a category 2 subsystem), the general driver initialization function *IO_Driver_Init()* has to be called with a safety configuration. Only then, the HY-TTC 500 platform can be considered to reliably transfer the system to a safe state in case of detected failures.

## 8.2.3 5 V Sensor Supplies

Category: Comment ID: 920236 The 5 V sensor supplies' correct functioning is implicitly checked by the HY-TTC 500 platform's I/O driver, if at least one safety-critical analog input is allocated to the corresponding sensor supply. To that end, the analog feedback signal is permanently checked for its voltage level and the I/O driver triggers an error callback in case of deviations. If there is no safety-critical analog input assigned to a specific 5 V sensor supply, but the overall system design requires diagnostic measures for the supply output, the application software can still read and evaluate the measured voltage level by calling the appropriate task function *IO_ADC_Get()* with the corresponding sensor supply parameter.

Due to the sensor supply's nature of providing a steady, defined output voltage, the analog feedback measurement is considered a reliable safety mechanism with a high diagnostic coverage. Consequently, the assumed diagnostic coverage for the 5 V sensor suppy is 99%.

## 8.2.4 Analog 3 Mode Inputs

Category: Comment ID: 920909 The analog 3 mode inputs can be utilized in fundamentally different applications, ranging from reading simple binary switches to current sensing elements, ratiometric output voltages or resistive sensor types. 

While the voltage and current measurement modes allow claiming a high diagnostic coverage even in single channel configuration, the resistance measurement might require additional measures to achieve certain DC levels.

* HW block, interface and electrical part of the external device ** Secondary pin can be from a different pin type
*** The external device's DC value might be lower (e.g. 60 %), unless specified by the manufacturer otherwise Note 1: The MTTFd values (as specified in the dedicated table in section MTTFd Values of Functional Blocks) are equally valid for all above-mentioned functional modes. Note 2: For those functional modes that require two input channels, the MTTFd value does only reflect the failure rate of a single channel.

## - Voltage Input / Current Input:

When using the voltage & current measurement modes, the analog 3 mode inputs' internal structure provides the HY-TTC 500 platform with the ability to internally diagnose hardware faults with a high diagnostic coverage. The I/O driver's diagnostic modules will trigger an error callback in case of a detected failure.

## Resistive Input:

Due to restrictions in the resistance measurement mode, the reference channel cannot be used to directly monitor the correct function of the analog input stage. Therefore, no implicitly executed safety mechanisms can be claimed by the system integrator for defining the input stages' diagnostic coverage values. Consequently, additional measures have to be implemented in the application software, if the overall safety function requires diagnostic coverage for the analog input stages.

## Digital Input:

In the digital input configuration, certain failure modes of the analog input stages might not be detectable by the HY-TTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules. Hence, a redundant usage of independent input stages is recommended for safety functions that require a certain diagnostic coverage.

Regardless of the measurement mode, the connected input elements (e.g. switches or sensors) might require the implementation of certain safety mechanisms, as well, to assure failure detection within those elements. Such mechanisms have to be selected according to the possible failure modes and the targeted failure rates.

## 8.2.4.1 Redundancy

Category: Comment ID: 920872 The redundant usage of two analog inputs allows for continuous cross monitoring of the corresponding input signal. Plausibility checks within the application software permit the system integrator to detect a single fault in one of the input paths and transfer the overall system to a safe state. When defining the time interval of such checks, the system integrator needs to consider the overall system's failure reaction time. For details on calculating the worst case failure reaction times of such consistency checks, see section *Failure Diagnostics*.

Redundancy can also be claimed when combining two different input types (e.g. an analog input 3 mode with an analog input 2 mode for current measurement, or an analog 2 mode with a timer input for measuring digital signals), as long as the inputs' specifications both match the desired input signal).

This safety mechanism's diagnostic coverage is considered to lie between a value of **90-99** %, depending on the characteristics of the input elements (e.g. their possible failure modes) and the plausibility check's strictness.

## - 8.2.4.2 Signal Range Check -

Category: Comment ID: 544467 In order to check for short circuits to ground or battery voltage as well as open loads of dedicated inputs, a signal range check (SRC) can be utilized. That means a predefined margin on the upper and lower end of the measurable range is excluded from the sensor's valid output values. If for the signal range check a range of 5â¦95 % is configured to be valid for a sensor, all values below 5 % or above 95 % are considered erroneous by the I/O driver.

In case the application software passes a safety configuration (i.e. defined signal ranges together with a redundant input channel) to the voltage/current input's initialization function, the measured values will be checked internally by the I/O driver for their upper and lower limits periodically during runtime and the I/O 
driver's diagnostic modules will trigger an error callback upon detection of a signal range violation. In case of single-channel configuration of 3 mode analog inputs or utilization as resistive inputs, the application software has to implement such a diagnostic measure. This measure can, of course, only be applied to input stages with sensors that allow to define lower and upper limit values that still lie within the measurable ranges.

Since this safety mechanism is able to detect only basic failure modes both internal and external to the HY-TTC 500 platform, the according diagnostic coverage is considered to be low, i.e. 60 %.

## 8.2.4.3 Internal Comparison Of Redundant Measurement Paths

Category: Comment ID: 959698 The analog 3 mode inputs' internal structure allows to continuously monitor the correct operation of the analog input stages. This procedure relies on an independent reference channel that allows permanent plausibility checks of the measurement channel when in voltage or current measurement modes. Failures will be detected by the I/O driver's diagnostic modules and trigger an according error callback. 

This safety measure is considered to provide a high diagnostic coverage (i.e. 99 %) for the internal input structure. The diagnostic capabilities for failures within the sensor device, however, might vary between different sensor devices and depend on their detailed internal diagnostics and the sensor's architectural category.

## - 8.2.5 Analog 2 Mode Inputs

Category: Comment ID: 920350 The analog 2 mode inputs enable ratiometric and absolute voltage measurements, as well as reading current sensors. According to the utilized input elements, different diagnostic measures might be suitable. 

Similar to the resistance measurement mode of the analog 3 mode inputs, the analog 2 mode inputs do not feature internal reference channels to claim diagnostic coverage values without additional measures.

* HW block, interface & electrical part of the external device
** Secondary pin can be from a different pin type Note 1: The MTTFd values (as specified in the dedicated table in section MTTFd Values of Functional Blocks) are equally valid for all above-mentioned functional modes Note 2: For those functional modes that require two input channels, the MTTFd value does only reflect the failure rate of a single channel.

Note 3: For details about the implementation of these safety measures see the according chapters in section *Analog Input 3 Modes*.

## - Voltage Input / Current Input:

Due to the analog 2 mode inputs' internal structure, internal diagnostics cannot realiably detect dangerous failures on their own. Even though a basic signal range check will be performed by the HYTTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules for redundantly configured analog inputs, additional measures might be required to achieve the overall safety function's diagnostic coverage for the analog input stages.

Digital Input: In the digital input configuration, certain failure modes of the analog input stages might not be detectable by the HY-TTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules. Hence, a redundant usage of independent input stages is recommended for safety functions that require a certain diagnostic coverage.

## 8.2.6 Timer Inputs (Io_Pwd_00 ... Io_Pwd_05)

Category: Comment ID: 591419 The HY-TTC 500 platform's timer inputs 00-05 (*IO_PWD_00 ... IO_PWD_05*) allow to directly measure the signals of dedicated frequency sensors with different output characteristics (e.g. PNP-type, NPNtype, current loop). Depending on the actual measurement mode, the execution of diverse safety measures might be feasible.

## - Timer Input:

For the timer input mode, the I/O driver's diagnostic modules allow to internally check the input signal for a predefined frequency and pulse width range. Apart from that, the application software can implement appropriate measures on their own, as well. Encoder Input:
The I/O driver's diagnostic modules allow defining a lower and upper threshold for the encoder's count value.

## Analog Input:

Similarly, the analog input measurement is not equipped with automatically enabled safety mechanisms. 

Therefore, no safety mechanisms can be claimed by the system integrator and additional measures have to be enabled, if the overall safety function requires diagnostic coverage for the analog input function.

## Digital Input:

In the digital input configuration, certain failure modes of the timer input stages might not be detectable by the HY-TTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules. Hence, a redundant usage of independent input stages is recommended for safety functions that require a certain diagnostic coverage.

Regardless of the measurement mode, the connected input elements (e.g. switches or sensors) might require the implementation of certain safety mechanisms, as well, to assure failure detection within those elements. Such mechanisms have to be selected according to the possible failure modes and the targeted failure rates.

## 8.2.6.1 Redundancy

Category: Comment ID: 923491 The redundant usage of two timer inputs allows for continuous cross monitoring of the corresponding input signal. Plausibility checks within the application software permit the system integrator to detect a single fault in one of the input paths and transfer the overall system to a safe state. When defining the time interval of such checks, the system integrator needs to consider the overall system's failure reaction time. For details on calculating the worst case failure reaction times of such consistency checks, see section *Failure Diagnostics*. Redundancy can also be claimed when combining two different input types (e.g. a timer input's analog measurement with an analog input 2 mode, or a timer input's digital measurement with an analog input 3 mode for measuring static digital values), as long as the inputs' specifications both match the desired input signal. This safety mechanism's diagnostic coverage is considered to lie between a value of **90-99** %, depending on the characteristics of the input elements (e.g. their possible failure modes) and the plausibility check's strictness.

## - 8.2.6.2 Frequency Range Check - -

Category: Comment ID: 923493 In order to check for short circuits to ground or battery voltage as well as open loads of dedicated inputs, a frequency range check can be utilized. That means that predefined upper and lower limits for the measurement signals (in terms of frequency and pulse width) are defined. If for the signal range check a frequency range of 1 kHzâ¦10 kHz is configured to be valid for a sensor, all values below 1 kHz or above 10 kHz are considered erroneous by the I/O driver.

For the timer input mode, the application software may pass a safety configuration (i.e. defined signal ranges) to the input's initialization function. The measured values will then be checked internally by the I/O drivers for their upper and lower limits periodically during runtime. This measure can, of course, only be applied to input stages with sensors that continuously generate output pulses even in their idle state.

The internal signal range check can, however, not be used for the analog input mode of the timer inputs. It is, therefore, in the responsibility of the application software to implement such a range check for the analog input mode. Since this safety mechanism is able to detect numerous failure modes both internal and external to the HY-TTC 500 platform, the according diagnostic coverage for the timer input mode is considered to be medium to high, i.e. **90-99** %, depending on the range of invalid measurement values.

## 8.2.6.3 Signal Range Check

Category: Comment ID: 959614 In order to check for short circuits to ground or battery voltage as well as open loads of dedicated inputs, a signal range check (SRC) can be utilized. That means a predefined margin on the upper and lower end of the measurable range is excluded from the sensor's valid output values. If for the signal range check a range of 5â¦95 % is considered to be valid for a sensor, all values below 5 % or above 95 % can be considered erroneous. The application software might check the measured values for their upper and lower limits periodically during runtime and is able to initiate the safe state upon detection of a signal range violation. This measure can, of course, only be applied to input stages with sensors that allow to define lower and upper limit values that still lie within the measurable ranges.

Since this safety mechanism is able to detect only basic failure modes both internal and external to the HY-TTC 500 platform, the according diagnostic coverage is considered to be low, i.e. 60 %.

## 8.2.7 Timer Inputs (Io_Pwd_06 ... Io_Pwd_11)

Category: Comment ID: 959339 The HY-TTC 500 platform's timer inputs 06-11 (*IO_PWD_06 ... IO_PWD_11*) allow to directly measure the signals of dedicated frequency sensors with different output characteristics (e.g. PNP-type, NPNtype, current loop). However, due to their internal structure, these timer inputs **must not** be utilized safety-critically on their own in measurement modes timer input, encoder input or digital input.

Depending on the actual measurement mode, the execution of diverse safety measures might be 

feasible.

* HW input, interface and electrical part of the external device
** Only usable in combination with a timer input from group *IO_PWD_00 ... IO_PWD_05*. *** Only usable in combination with a digital input from groups *IO_ADC_00 ... IO_ADC_23, IO_PWD_00* 
... IO_PWD_05, IO_DO_00 ... IO_DO_15 or IO_PVG_00 ... IO_PVG_07.

Note: For details about the implementation of these safety measures see the according chapters in the above section *Timer Inputs (IO_PWD_00 ... IO_PWD_05*).

## - Timer Input:

Due to their internal structure, the timer inputs 6-11 (*IO_PWD_06 ... IO_PWD_11*) in measurement mode timer input **must not** be utilized safety-critically on their own or in combination with another timer input from this group. They may be used, however, as secondary channels in a redundant architecture in combination with timer inputs 0-5 (*IO_PWD_00 ... IO_PWD_05*).

## Analog Input:

Similarly, the analog input measurement is not equipped with automatically enabled safety mechanisms. 

Therefore, no safety mechanisms can be claimed by the system integrator and additional measures have to be enabled, if the overall safety function requires diagnostic coverage for the analog input function.

## Digital Input:

Due to their internal structure, the timer inputs 6-11 (*IO_PWD_06 ... IO_PWD_11*) in measurement mode digital input **must not** be utilized safety-critically on their own or in combination with another timer input from this group. They may be used, however, as secondary channels in a redundant architecture in combination with dedicated analog inputs, timer inputs 0-5, dedicated digital outputs or PVG outputs (*IO_ADC_00 ... IO_ADC_23, IO_PWD_00 ... IO_PWD_05, IO_DO_00 ... IO_DO_15 or IO_PVG_00 ...* IO_PVG_07).

## 8.2.8 Pwm High Side Stages

Category: Comment ID: 921278 The PWM high side stages allow operation of both resistive and inductive loads in a safety-critical manner. Due to the PWM control, they feature a continuous monitoring mechanism in the granularity of the PWM frequency. With internal safety switches being able to override a faulty power stage output, an independent secondary shut-off path is present to transfer the system to a safe state, in case of dangerous failures.

* HW block, interface and electrical part of the external device (MP_C = Mission Profile *Conventional* / MP_S = Mission Profile *Stop & Go*)
** Secondary shut-off path can be, e.g. internal safety switch, an independent output stage or a hydraulic shut-off valve. *** The metrics of the *HS PWM Current Measurement* mode need to be added to the metrics of the HS PWM Output mode in case the current measurement is considered safety-critical in the overall system.

**** The *HS PWM Current Measurement* mode does not require an additional connector pin as it will base its measurement on the according HS PWM output pin.

***** Only usable in combination with a digital input from groups *IO_ADC_00 ... IO_ADC_23,* IO_PWD_00 ... IO_PWD_05, IO_DO_00 ... IO_DO_15 or IO_PVG_00 ... IO_PVG_07.

## Hs Pwm Output:

The I/O driver's diagnostic module continuously compares the desired output duty cycle and frequency with the feedback measurements, thus allowing to reliably detect failures within the PWM output stages. This measure is active for every PWM high side output that is initialized as safety-critical and will trigger an error callback in case of dangerous failures. Due to their superior diagnostic capabilities, the system integrator is advised to use the PWM output mode rather than the digital output mode for safety-critical applications, even if the corresponding actuators are only operated statically. This can be achieved by implementing a pseude-digital mode, that only changes between minimum and maximum output duty cycles.

## Hs Pwm Current Measurement:

In case the PWM output stages current measurement is also defined as safety-critical, the I/O driver's diagnostic module provides an implicitly executed range check that is able to detect basic failures within the current measurement path of the output stage. When detecting such failures, the I/O driver's diagnostic module will trigger an error callback. If the system integrator requires higher DC values, the implementation of additional measures (e.g. plausibility checks of the measured current values) within the application software is required.

## - - - Hs Digital Output:

If explicitly configured as digital outputs, the PWM high side stages will be operated statically and will not make use of any PWM signals. The state of such digital outputs will not be automatically monitored by the I/O driver's diagnostic modules. An according plausibility check of the digital feedback value needs to be implemented by the system integrator.

## Digital Input:

Due to their internal structure, the PWM ouput stages in measurement mode digital input **must not** be utilized safety-critically on their own or in combination with another input from this group. They may be used, however, as secondary channels in a redundant architecture in combination with dedicated analog inputs, timer inputs 0-5, dedicated digital outputs or PVG outputs (*IO_ADC_00 ... IO_ADC_23,* IO_PWD_00 ... IO_PWD_05, IO_DO_00 ... IO_DO_15 or IO_PVG_00 ... IO_PVG_07).

## 8.2.8.1 Plausibility Check

Category: Comment ID: 923888 The integrity of the measured PWM output current can be checked by performing dedicated plausibility checks with independent measurement signals. That could be, for example, the direct comparison to an independent current sensor or the evaluation of the controlled actuators' physical state (with position or speed sensors). Another practical plausibility check for the safety-critical current measurement would be to check the actual current measurement value against an expected current, based on the PWM output's duty cycle and the actuator's resistive characteristics.

Depending on the plausibility check's strictness, diagnostic coverage values between 90 % and 99 % are considered feasible.

## 8.2.8.2 Status Monitoring

Category: Comment ID: 923591 The digital state of the PWM high side outputs can be read via the static feedback signals. That way, the application software is able to verify the correct function of the digital high side outputs and activate the safe state in case of dangerous failures. The additional internal safety switches constitute a secondary shut-off path that can de-energize the actuators independently from the PWM power stages. This safety mechanism allows to detect a substantial amount of possible hardware failures and is therefore considered to yield a DC value of 90 %.

Category: Comment ID: 1194918 In order to check the proper operation of the secondary shut-off path, its ability to transfer the system into a safe state needs to be tested in certain intervals, e.g. at the beginning of each driving cycle or during pre-defined maintenance activities. That way, the system can be considered to offer a valid category 2 architecture, according to ISO 13849.

## 8.2.8.4 Redundancy

Category: Comment ID: 921253 The redundant usage of independent digital inputs allows for continuous cross monitoring of the corresponding input signal. Plausibility checks within the application software permit the system integrator to detect a single fault in one of the input paths and transfer the overall system to a safe state. When defining the time interval of such checks, the system integrator needs to consider the overall system's failure reaction time. For details on calculating the worst case failure reaction times of such consistency checks, see section *Failure Diagnostics*.

Redundancy can also be claimed when combining two different input types (e.g. a PWM stage's digital input measurement with an timer input, or a PWM stage's digital input measurement with the digital sampling of an analog input 3 mode), as long as the inputs' specifications both match the desired input signal.

This safety mechanism's diagnostic coverage is considered to lie between a value of **90-99** %, depending on the characteristics of the input elements (e.g. their possible failure modes) and the plausibility check's strictness.

## 8.2.9 Digital High Side Stages

Category: Comment ID: 894367 The digital high side stages allow operation of both resistive and inductive loads in a safety-critical manner. They feature internal feedback mechanisms that allow continuous monitoring of the effective output voltage. In case of dangerous failures, the assigned low side outputs act as secondary shut-off paths that provide the ability for transfering the system into a safe state.

** Secondary shut-off path, i.e. a dedicated digital low side output, needs to be configured during pin initialization. *** Secondary shut-off path can be, e.g. an independent output stage or a hydraulic shut-off valve.

## - - Hs Digital Output:

The I/O driver's diagnostic module continuously compares the desired output status with the feedback measurements, thus allowing to detect failures within the digital high side output stages. This measure is active for every pair of digital high side output and digital low side output that is initialized as safetycritical and will trigger an error callback in case of dangerous failures.

If the digital high side output is not configured safety-criticalâand thus, is not used in combination with a digital low side outputâno safety measures are executed by the I/O driver's diagnostic modules.

Analog Input: The digital high side stages' analog input measurement is not equipped with automatically enabled safety mechanisms. Therefore, no safety mechanisms can be claimed by the system integrator and additional measures have to be enabled, if the overall safety function requires diagnostic coverage for the analog input function.

## Digital Input:

In the digital input configuration, certain failure modes of the digital high side stages (including an unintentional activation of power stages) might not be detectable by the HY-TTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules. Hence, a redundant usage of independent input stages is recommended for safety functions that require a certain diagnostic coverage.

## 8.2.9.1 Voltage Monitoring

Category: Comment ID: 924316 The current state of the digital high side outputs can be read via the static voltage feedback signals. That way, the application software is able to verify the correct function of the digital high side outputs and activate the safe state in case of dangerous failures. If the independent digital low side outputs are not used as secondary shut-off paths, the system integrator is responsible to provide other means that allow bringing the overall system to a safe state, e.g. by a separate emergency valve that disrupts the hydraulic oil flow and stops any dangerous movements.

This safety mechanism allows to detect a substantial amount of possible hardware failures andâwith a proper secondary shut-off path in placeâis therefore considered to yield a DC value of 90 %.

## 8.2.9.2 Shut-Off Path Test - - -

Category: Comment ID: 964457 In order to check the proper operation of the secondary shut-off path, its ability to transfer the system into a safe state needs to be tested in certain intervals, e.g. at the beginning of each driving cycle or during pre-defined maintenance activities. That way, the system can be considered to offer a valid category 2 architecture, according to ISO 13849.

## 8.2.9.3 Redundancy

Category: Comment ID: 894468 The redundant usage of independent inputs allows for continuous cross monitoring of the corresponding input signal. Plausibility checks within the application software permit the system integrator to detect a single fault in one of the input paths and transfer the overall system to a safe state. When defining the time interval of such checks, the system integrator needs to consider the overall system's failure reaction time. For details on calculating the worst case failure reaction times of such consistency checks, see section *Failure Diagnostics*.

Redundancy can also be claimed when combining two different input types (e.g. a digital output stage's analog input measurement with an analog input 3 mode, or a digital output stage's digital input measurement with a timer input), as long as the inputs' specifications both match the desired input signal.

This safety mechanism's diagnostic coverage is considered to lie between a value of **90-99** %, depending on the characteristics of the input elements (e.g. their possible failure modes) and the plausibility check's strictness.

## 8.2.9.4 Signal Range Check

Category: Comment ID: 923589 In order to check for short circuits to ground or battery voltage as well as open loads of dedicated inputs, a signal range check (SRC) can be utilized. That means a predefined margin on the upper and lower end of the measurable range is excluded from the sensor's valid output values. If for the signal range check a range of 5â¦95 % is considered to be valid for a sensor, all values below 5 % or above 95 % should be considered erroneous by the application software.

Unlike the analog 2 mode and 3 mode inputs, the digital high side outputs do not offer an internal signal range check that is executed by the I/O driver's diagnostic modules. It is, therefore, in the responsibility of the application software to implement such a range check. Since this safety mechanism is able to detect only basic failure modes both internal and external to the HY-TTC 500 platform, the according diagnostic coverage is considered to be low, i.e. 60 %.

## 8.2.10 Digital Low Side Stages

Category: Comment ID: 894369 The digital low side stages allow operation of both resistive and inductive loads in a safety-critical manner. They feature internal feedback mechanisms that allow continuous monitoring of the effective output voltage. In case of dangerous failures, the assigned low side outputs act as secondary shut-off paths that provide the ability for transfering the system into a safe state.

* HW block, interface and electrical part of the external device ** Secondary shut-off path, i.e. a dedicated digital low side output, needs to be configured during pin initialization. *** Secondary shut-off path can be, e.g. an independent output stage or a hydraulic shut-off valve.

## - Ls Digital Output:

The I/O driver's diagnostic module continuously compares the desired output status with the feedback measurements, thus allowing to detect failures within the digital low side output stages. This measure is active for every pair of digital high side output and digital low side output that is initialized as safetycritical and will trigger an error callback in case of dangerous failures.

If the digital low side output is not configured safety-criticalâand thus, is not used in combination with a digital high side outputâno safety measures are executed by the I/O driver's diagnostic modules.

## Analog Input:

The digital low side stages' analog input measurement is not equipped with automatically enabled safety mechanisms. Therefore, no safety mechanisms can be claimed by the system integrator and additional measures have to be enabled, if the overall safety function requires diagnostic coverage for the analog input function.

## Digital Input:

In the digital input configuration, certain failure modes of the digital low side stages (including an unintentional activation of power stages) might not be detectable by the HY-TTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules. Hence, a redundant usage of independent input stages is recommended for safety functions that require a certain diagnostic coverage.

## 8.2.10.1 Voltage Monitoring

Category: Comment ID: 924656 The current state of the digital low side outputs can be read via the static voltage feedback signals. That way, the application software is able to verify the correct function of the digital low side outputs and activate the safe state in case of dangerous failures. If the independent digital high side outputs are not used as secondary shut-off paths, the system integrator is responsible to provide other means that allow bringing the overall system to a safe state, e.g. by a separate emergency valve that disrupts the hydraulic oil flow and stops any dangerous movements. This safety mechanism allows to detect a substantial amount of possible hardware failures andâwith a proper secondary shut-off path in placeâis therefore considered to yield a DC value of 90 %.

## - 8.2.10.2 Shut-Off Path Test - -

Category: Comment ID: 964475 In order to check the proper operation of the secondary shut-off path, its ability to transfer the system into a safe state needs to be tested in certain intervals, e.g. at the beginning of each driving cycle or during pre-defined maintenance activities. That way, the system can be considered to offer a valid category 2 architecture, according to ISO 13849.

## 8.2.10.3 Redundancy

Category: Comment ID: 924660 The redundant usage of independent inputs allows for continuous cross monitoring of the corresponding input signal. Plausibility checks within the application software permit the system integrator to detect a single fault in one of the input paths and transfer the overall system to a safe state. When defining the time interval of such checks, the system integrator needs to consider the overall system's failure reaction time. For details on calculating the worst case failure reaction times of such consistency checks, see section *Failure Diagnostics*. Redundancy can also be claimed when combining two different input types (e.g. a digital output stage's analog input measurement with an analog input 3 mode, or a digital output stage's digital input measurement with a timer input), as long as the inputs' specifications both match the desired input signal. This safety mechanism's diagnostic coverage is considered to lie between a value of **90-99** %, depending on the characteristics of the input elements (e.g. their possible failure modes) and the plausibility check's strictness.

## 8.2.10.4 Signal Range Check

Category: Comment ID: 924652 In order to check for short circuits to ground or battery voltage as well as open loads of dedicated inputs, a signal range check (SRC) can be utilized. That means a predefined margin on the upper and lower end of the measurable range is excluded from the sensor's valid output values. If for the signal range check a range of 5â¦95 % is considered to be valid for a sensor, all values below 5 % or above 95 % should be considered erroneous by the application software. Unlike the analog 2 mode and 3 mode inputs, the digital low side outputs do not offer an internal signal range check that is executed by the I/O driver's diagnostic modules. It is, therefore, in the responsibility of the application software to implement such a range check.

Since this safety mechanism is able to detect only basic failure modes both internal and external to the HY-TTC 500 platform, the according diagnostic coverage is considered to be low, i.e. 60 %.

## - 8.2.11 High Side Digital / Pvg / Vout Output

| Category:   | Comment   | ID:   | 924869   |
|-------------|-----------|-------|----------|
| The high side digital output stages with PVG and VOUT mode do not directly allow safety-critical  operation of any loads. They do feature internal feedback mechanisms that allow continuous monitoring  of the effective output voltage but none of these measures are automatically executed by the I/O driver's  diagnostic modules. Also, they do not provide an integral shut-off path that would allow to independently  de-energize an erroneous output stage.

* HW block, interface and electrical part of the external device ** Secondary shut-off path can be, e.g. an independent output stage or a hydraulic shut-off valve.

## - Hs Digital Output:

The state of the digital high side outputs will not be automatically monitored by the I/O driver's diagnostic modules. An according plausibility check of the output stage's feedback value needs to be implemented by the system integrator, if required by the overall system architecture. Analog Input:
The high side digital output stages' analog input measurement is not equipped with automatically enabled safety mechanisms. Therefore, no safety mechanisms can be claimed by the system integrator and additional measures have to be enabled, if the overall safety function requires diagnostic coverage for the analog input function.

Digital Input:
In the digital input configuration, certain failure modes of the digital high side stages (including an unintentional activation of power stages) might not be detectable by the HY-TTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules. Hence, a redundant usage of independent input stages is recommended for safety functions that require a certain diagnostic coverage.

## 8.2.11.1 Status Monitoring

Category: Comment ID: 924867 The current state of the digital high side outputs can be read via the static feedback signals. That way, the application software is able to verify the correct function of the digital high side outputs and activate the safe state in case of dangerous failures. Since the HY-TTC 500 platform does not offer an integral shut-off path that allows to independently disable the connected actuator, the system integrator is responsible to provide other means that allow bringing the overall system to a safe state, e.g. by a separate emergency valve that disrupts the hydraulic oil flow and stops any dangerous movements or by utilizing an independent digital low side output of the HY-TTC 500 platform. This safety mechanism allows to detect a substantial amount of possible hardware failures andâwith a proper secondary shut-off path in placeâis therefore considered to yield a DC value of 90 %.

## - 8.2.11.2 Shut-Off Path Test - -

Category: Comment ID: 964502 In order to check the proper operation of the secondary shut-off path, its ability to transfer the system into a safe state needs to be tested in certain intervals, e.g. at the beginning of each driving cycle or during pre-defined maintenance activities. That way, the system can be considered to offer a valid category 2 architecture, according to ISO 13849.

## 8.2.11.3 Redundancy

Category: Comment ID: 925634 The redundant usage of independent inputs allows for continuous cross monitoring of the corresponding input signal. Plausibility checks within the application software permit the system integrator to detect a single fault in one of the input paths and transfer the overall system to a safe state. When defining the time interval of such checks, the system integrator needs to consider the overall system's failure reaction time. For details on calculating the worst case failure reaction times of such consistency checks, see section *Failure Diagnostics*.

Redundancy can also be claimed when combining two different input types (e.g. a digital output stage's analog input measurement with an analog input 3 mode, or a digital output stage's digital input measurement with a timer input), as long as the inputs' specifications both match the desired input signal. This safety mechanism's diagnostic coverage is considered to lie between a value of **90-99** %, depending on the characteristics of the input elements (e.g. their possible failure modes) and the plausibility check's strictness.

## 8.2.11.4 Signal Range Check

Category: Comment ID: 925638 In order to check for short circuits to ground or battery voltage as well as open loads of dedicated inputs, a signal range check (SRC) can be utilized. That means a predefined margin on the upper and lower end of the measurable range is excluded from the sensor's valid output values. If for the signal range check a range of 5â¦95 % is configured to be valid for a sensor, all values below 5 % or above 95 % should be considered erroneous by the application software.

Unlike the analog 2 mode and 3 mode inputs, the digital high side outputs do not offer an internal signal range check that is executed by the I/O driver's diagnostic modules. It is, therefore, in the responsibility of the application software to implement such a range check. Since this safety mechanism is able to detect only basic failure modes both internal and external to the HY-TTC 500 platform, the according diagnostic coverage is considered to be low, i.e. 60 %.

## 9 Guideline On Sensor Selection - - -

Category: Comment ID: 592065 The following section shall provide a general overview of commonly used sensors and will discuss their interoperability with the dedicated sensor inputs of the HY-TTC 500 platform. This section is only considered a guideline and does not alter any requirements stated in the herein before mentioned sections.

## 9.1 Analog Sensors

Category: Comment ID: 592087 For being capable of providing analog inputs for safety-critical applications, the HY-TTC 500 platform requires diagnostic measures to be present within the analog input path. Depending on the analog input type, the system integrator may have to comply with specific requirements in order to allow safety-critical utilization, as specified in the before-mentioned section *Analog Inputs*.

The following section will describe typical analog sensor types together with their detailed characteristics.

## 9.1.1 Usage Of Redundant Sensors

Category: Comment ID: 592125 Redundantly connected sensors do allow the reliable detection of failures within a single sensor path. 

However, for those failures that commonly compromise both sensor signals at once, e.g. short circuits between the separate sensor lines, dedicated preconditions are necessary.

## 9.1.1.1 Diverse Sensor Characteristics

Category: Comment ID: 592129 If redundant sensors are used for detection of short circuits between sensor lines, external to the ECU, 
sensors with diverse characteristics are recommended in order to continuously monitor the signal lines for external short circuits. The following types of diverse sensors are commonly used:
- Two identical potentiometers with opposite characteristics (i.e. when changing the physical input value, one sensor reacts with an increasing sensor value while the other one reacts with a decreasing sensor value). With a short circuit between those two sensors, the ECU will measure a value of 50 % full range for both sensors. This output value is plausible but wrong.

As a consequence, this kind of diverse sensor operation is only feasible for sensors that result in safe output conditions when emitting a sensor value of 50 %. This could be, for example, a joystick containing two sensors with opposite characteristics. In its idle position, as well as when the sensor lines are shorted, it outputs sensor values of 50 %, each. Basically, a short circuit would not be detected by the application software, but this condition would lead to a safe condition, anyway.

- Two identical potentiometers with different proportional factor at their outputs. That could mean, for example, that the one sensor outputs a value that is double the voltage of the second sensor, for any position. That way, the both sensors can never show the same output values at the same time, enabling the application software to detect short circuits between these sensor lines.

## 9.1.1.2 Indentical Sensor Characteristics

Category: Comment ID: 592133 When identical sensors are used for redundancy, short circuits between both sensor lines cannot be detected, per se. However, two identical sensors will allow best precision regarding measurement accuracy.

Since the HY-TTC 500 platform does provide measures to identify external short circuits between two redundantly used sensors with identical characteristics, the system integrator can rely on the mechanisms to detect these external short circuits during start-up, as described in section *External Short* Circuit Check.

## 9.1.2 Potentiometric Analog Sensors

Category: Comment ID: 592117 Potentiometric analog sensors are commonly used for analog position sensors (e.g. pedals or joysticks), 
movement sensors or active sensors that resemble the behavior of potentiometers. These sensors produce an analog output voltage that is proportional to the mechanical position as well as to the sensor supply. Consequently, a linear position sensor being in its center position will show an output signal with a voltage of exactly 50 % of the sensor supply voltage. By using the ratiometric measurement, the sensor supply's error does not influence the measurement value accuracy. Please note that it is not allowed to supply a sensor by one ECU and measure the sensor's output signal on another ECU. Ground shifts between the two ECUs would considerably degrade the measurement accuracy.

Category: Comment ID: 592123 The following figure shows the typical wiring of potentiometric analog sensors.

In addition to the wires, there is an electronic component called a CPU that appears to be part of the system's design. The diagram also features a reference to Figure 5, which might provide more context or information about the overall structure of the system.)

## 9.1.3  Current Loop Sensors

ID: 592119 Category:
 Comment Current loop sensors are typically 2-wire sensors with one wire being connected to battery supply, while the other wire is connected to an ECU's analog input with current measurement capabilities. The standard current range is given with 4â¦24mA, where 4 mA corresponds to the minimum physical value while 24 mA is the maximum valid measurement value.

The diagram is labeled with different labels to indicate specific components or their functions within the circuit. A bar graph can be seen in the middle-left section of the image, which might represent voltage levels or other relevant data related to the electronic circuit.)

## 9.2 Digital Sensors

Category: Comment ID: 592069 For being capable of providing digital inputs for safety-critical applications, the HY-TTC 500 platform requires diagnostic measures to be present within the digital timer input path. When using general digital sensors, the redundant usage of separate digital timer inputs is a necessary requirement to the system integrator. The following section will describe typical digital sensor types together with their detailed characteristics.

## 9.2.1 Pwm Position Sensors

Category: Comment ID: 592073 Typically, PWM position sensors are analog sensors (pedals, joystick) with potentiometers or contactless active sensors providing PWM signals. The PWM duty cycle is proportional to the measured physical quantity. PWM sensors may be supplied by a 5 V supply as well as being directly connected to battery voltage.

Since these sensors typically do not provide any means to reliably detect failures (e.g. short circuits or open circuits of the sensor lines), a redundant utilization of separate timer inputs is required. The application has to monitor and compare the measurement values and has to enter the safe state, in case of deviations between the independent inputs.

The diagram also includes a timer and a control unit, with some of these components labeled for better understanding. Overall, it is a detailed representation of an electronic system that incorporates various functional parts to create a cohesive circuit.)

Category: Comment ID: 592075 The following figure shows the typical wiring of PWM position sensors.

## 9.2.2 Rpm Sensors

Category: Comment ID: 592079 RPM sensors are active sensors with mainly magnetically sensitive detectors. The HY-TTC 500 platform is compatible to those RPM sensors that feature 3-wire connection and can be supplied with either 5 V or battery voltage while providing push-pull or open collector output stages.

A rotary sensor wheel (toothed gear wheel) produces a rectangular output signal on the sensor input, with one pulse being emitted for each tooth that passes the sensor wheel.

Without rotation, the output is statically low or high, depending on whether there is a tooth or a gap next to the active sensor region. When using traditional sensors, however, an idle sensor may be confused with a defective sensor connection (i.e. a shorted sensor line or a broken wire). In order to distinguish between the conditions no speed or *defective sensor*, the following measures can be applied:
- An RPM sensor that emits a test pulse (e.g. one pulse every 100 ms) while standing still. If the signal is stuck at any level, the application can expect the sensor or its signal lines to be defective and may activate the safe state.

- The redundant utilization of two separate timer inputs. By comparing the measured values of both sensor inputs, the application can identify sensor failures and change to the safe state.

Category: Comment ID: 592081 The following figure shows the typical wiring of RPM sensors.

There are several wires and connections visible throughout the circuit, indicating that it is a complex system. A few key components include a computer, a sensor, and a timer.

The diagram also features various labels, such as "push-pull stage," "ground," and "LND." These labels provide context for understanding the function of each component within the circuit. The overall layout of the circuit is organized in a way that allows for efficient communication between different parts of the system.)

## 9.2.3 Digital Switches

Category: Comment ID: 592099 Digital switches that statically emit logical high or low levels, do not provide any measures for detection of potential failures, typically. Thus, the system integrator has to redundantly utilize two separate inputs when requiring safety-critical inputs. The application software is responsible for comparing the measurements and change to the safe state in case of discrepancies between both input values.

Category: Comment ID: 592101 During operation, redundantly used digital switches may show a certain offset regarding their actual switching threshold. Consequently, there may be a particular time period where the comparison of the sensors' input values appears to be implausible. The system integrator is advised to provide adequate debouncing of those intermediate states within the application software.

## - - 9.3 External Short Circuit Check -

Category: Comment ID: 592623 For detecting short circuits between two redundantly used sensors, the HY-TTC 500 platform provides independent sensor supply outputs and the ability to separately disable them, one by one. Redundant sensors are to be connected to different sensor supplies. That way, the freedom from short circuits can be checked during start-up by disabling a sensor supply output and verifying that the signals of all supplied sensors drop to a value close to zero. If a corresponding sensor still emits legal sensor values, a short circuit to a redundant (and still supplied) sensor is very likely. These short circuit checks will, however, not be performed by the diagnostic modules provided with the HY-TTC 500 platform. Instead, they need to be implemented within the application software. A possible implementation for such a short circuit check would be a start-up test that sequentially enables the sensor supplies and checks the corresponding set of functional sensors for each sensor supply state.
