## 3 Getting Started

TTControl GmbH recommends using the HY-TTC 500 Starter Kit, because it includes all components required for smooth development. There are two variants of the HY-TTC 500 Starter Kit available: one for C programming (with JTAG-Adapter and open housing) and one for CODESYS programming. This Quick Start Guide is for the C programming variant (see Figure 3.2 on the following page). For the CODESYS programming variant, see [5]. Note that the Ethernet USB adapter is only part of the starter kit if the corresponding HY-TTC 500 ECU is equipped with an Ethernet interface. <chunk_seperator> [12] ISO.

 Question:  What is the purpose of the HY-TTC 500 Starter Kit for C programming?","The purpose of the HY-TTC 500 Starter Kit for C programming is to provide all the necessary components for smooth development in a single package. This starter kit is specifically designed for C programming and includes the essential tools and hardware required to get started with the HY-TTC 500 development process. 

The HY-TTC 500 Starter Kit for C programming includes the JTAG-Adapter and open housing, which are crucial components for debugging and programming the HY-TTC 500 microcontroller. The kit also includes other necessary components, such as the Ethernet USB adapter, if the corresponding HY-TTC 500 ECU is equipped with an Ethernet interface. 

By using the HY-TTC 500 Starter Kit for C programming, developers can ensure that they have all the required tools and hardware to develop, test, and deploy their C programming projects on the HY-TTC 500 platform. This starter kit is recommended by TTControl GmbH as it provides a comprehensive and convenient way to get started with HY-TTC 500 development, allowing developers to focus on their project goals without worrying about missing components or compatibility issues."

 Question:  What is the difference between the HY-TTC 500 Starter Kit for C programming and the HY-TTC 500 Starter Kit for CODESYS programming?","The difference between the HY-TTC 500 Starter Kit for C programming and the HY-TTC 500 Starter Kit for CODESYS programming lies in the components included and the programming environment they support.

The HY-TTC 500 Starter Kit for C programming, as shown in Figure 3.2 [image_id.png], includes all the necessary components for smooth development in a C programming environment. This kit is specifically designed for C programming and includes a JTAG-Adapter and an open housing.

On the other hand, the HY-TTC 500 Starter Kit for CODESYS programming, mentioned in [5], is designed for CODESYS programming and has a different set of components. The main difference is that the CODESYS programming variant does not include a JTAG-Adapter and open housing, as these components are not required for CODESYS programming.

Additionally, the Ethernet USB adapter is only part of the starter kit if the corresponding HY-TTC 500 ECU is equipped with an Ethernet interface. This means that if the ECU has an Ethernet interface, the Ethernet USB adapter will be included in both starter kits, but if it does not, the adapter will not be included.

In summary, the main difference between the two starter kits is the programming environment they support, with the C programming variant including a JTAG-Adapter and open housing, and the CODESYS programming variant not including these components."

 Question:  What is the significance of the jumper settings for CAN0, CAN1, and CAN2, as shown in the table?","The significance of the jumper settings for CAN0, CAN1, and CAN2, as shown in the table, refers to the configuration of the CAN (Controller Area Network) interface on the HY-TTC 500 ECU (Electronic Control Unit).

In the table, we see that each CAN interface (CAN0, CAN1, CAN2, and CAN3) has a specific jumper setting, which determines how the CAN interface is connected to other components in the system.

For example, CAN0 is connected to pins 235 and 209, and also to pins 222 and 248. This specific jumper setting defines the communication path for the CAN0 interface, allowing it to exchange data with other devices or modules in the system.

Similarly, CAN1 is connected to pins 236 and 210, and also to pins 223 and 249. This configuration enables the CAN1 interface to communicate with specific components or devices in the system.

The same applies to CAN2 and CAN3, each with its unique jumper setting defining its communication path.

These jumper settings are crucial in ensuring that the CAN interfaces operate correctly, allowing the HY-TTC 500 ECU to control and monitor various functions in the system.

In the context of the HY-TTC 500 Starter Kit, these jumper settings are essential for establishing the proper connections between the ECU and other components, such as sensors, actuators, or other ECUs.

In summary, the jumper settings for CAN0, CAN1, and CAN2, as shown in the table, determine how the CAN interfaces are configured to communicate with other components in the system, enabling the HY-TTC 500 ECU to perform its intended functions."

 Question:  What are the steps to connect the power supply GND to the black socket named **BAT-**, as described in the Hy-TTC 500 Power Supply section?","To connect the power supply GND to the black socket named **BAT-**, as described in the Hy-TTC 500 Power Supply section, you need to follow these steps:

First, locate the power supply GND, which is usually a ground wire or a negative terminal of the power supply unit. Next, identify the black socket named **BAT-** on the Hy-TTC 500 board. This socket is typically located on the connector terminal block.

Once you have identified both the power supply GND and the **BAT-** socket, connect the power supply GND to the black socket named **BAT-**. Make sure the connection is secure and not loose, as a loose connection can cause damage to the board or the power supply unit.

Additionally, you need to connect the positive power supply to the red socket named **BAT+ Power** and to **BAT+ CPU** on the connector terminal block. This is done by short-circuiting **BAT+ CPU** to **BAT+ Power**.

It is essential to follow these steps carefully to ensure the proper functioning of the Hy-TTC 500 Power Supply. Failure to connect the power supply GND to the **BAT-** socket correctly can lead to malfunction or damage to the board.

The Hy-TTC 500 Power Supply section provides detailed instructions on how to connect the power supply GND to the **BAT-** socket, and it is crucial to follow these instructions carefully to avoid any potential issues."

The switching threshold of the LEDs is min. 8 V and max. 8.9 V (to guarantee a voltage >8 V over all parts tolerances).
 Question:  What is the purpose of putting the jumper to **Always on** mode in the HY-TTC 500?","The purpose of putting the jumper to **Always on** mode in the HY-TTC 500 is to ensure that the device remains in an active state, independent of Terminal 15. This means that the HY-TTC 500 will continue to operate and function normally, regardless of the state of Terminal 15. 

In other words, by setting the jumper to **Always on** mode, the HY-TTC 500 will not rely on Terminal 15 to power up or remain active. This can be useful in situations where Terminal 15 is not available or is not providing power, and the HY-TTC 500 needs to continue operating."

The switching threshold of the LEDs is min. 8 V and max. 8.9 V (to guarantee a voltage >8 V over all parts tolerances).
 Question:  WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF SETTING ALL SIX JUMPERS AS SHOWN IN FIGURE 4.10(a) FOR ETHERNET MODE?","The purpose of setting all six jumpers as shown in Figure 4.10(a) for Ethernet mode is to configure the HY-TTC 500 to operate in Ethernet mode. This mode is only available for the HY-TTC 580 model.

In Ethernet mode, the HY-TTC 500 can communicate with other devices over an Ethernet network, allowing for data transfer and communication between devices. By setting the jumpers as shown in Figure 4.10(a), the HY-TTC 500 is configured to use the Ethernet protocol for communication, enabling it to operate in this mode.

It's essential to note that the Ethernet mode is not available for all HY-TTC models, and it's only compatible with the HY-TTC 580. If you're using a different model, you'll need to use a different configuration, such as the BroadR-Reach mode, which is available for HY-TTC 590E, HY-TTC 590, and HY-TTC 508 models.

In summary, setting all six jumpers as shown in Figure 4.10(a) for Ethernet mode allows the HY-TTC 500 to operate in Ethernet mode, enabling Ethernet communication and data transfer, but this mode is only available for the HY-TTC 580 model."

 Question:  WHAT IS THE RECOMMENDATION FOR UNEXPERIENCED USERS OF THE HY-TTC 500 WHEN CHOOSING BETWEEN CAN OR JTAG OPTIONS?","For inexperienced users of the HY-TTC 500, it is recommended to use the CAN or JTAG option when choosing between CAN or JTAG options for download and debugging. This recommendation is stated in section 4.7 of the provided context, which discusses the options for downloading and debugging the HY-TTC 500.

The reason for this recommendation is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that using CAN or JTAG options is considered safer or more straightforward for inexperienced users. This might be because these options are more widely used or have more established procedures, making it easier for new users to follow and troubleshoot if needed.

In contrast, using the Ethernet option requires additional considerations, such as ensuring that the application listens to download requests on the Ethernet. This added complexity might make it more challenging for inexperienced users to successfully download and debug their applications on the HY-TTC 500.

Therefore, for inexperienced users, it is recommended to stick with the more traditional and widely used CAN or JTAG options to minimize potential issues and ensure a smoother development experience with the HY-TTC 500."

 Question:  What are the five directories that the developer package is extracted into?","The developer package is extracted into five directories, which are:

1. **Bootloader**: This directory likely contains files related to the bootloader, which is a critical component of an operating system that loads the operating system into memory when a computer is powered on.

2. **Documentation**: This directory contains documentation related to the developer package, which can include user manuals, guides, and other relevant information.

3. **FPGA_Bitstream**: This directory is likely related to Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), which are integrated circuits that can be programmed and reprogrammed after manufacturing. The Bitstream refers to the binary data that is used to configure the FPGA.

4. **Get_Started**: This directory contains files and resources to help users get started with the developer package. It may include tutorials, examples, and other materials to facilitate a smooth learning curve.

5. **Release_Notes**: This directory contains information about the release of the developer package, including details about new features, bug fixes, and other changes.

These five directories provide a structured approach to organizing the contents of the developer package, making it easier for users to navigate and find the resources they need."

 Question:  What is the purpose of the **Settings.mk** file, and what settings can be modified in it?","The purpose of the **Settings.mk** file is to provide settings to the **Makefile** that control the compilation process. This file contains various configuration options that can be modified to customize the build process according to specific needs.

In the **Settings.mk** file, several settings can be modified, including:

1. **DOWNLOADER_HW_TYPE**: This setting specifies the hardware type for which the code should be compiled. It is used by **AddAPDB.exe** to generate the correct code for the target hardware.

2. **BOOTLOADER_VERSION**: This setting specifies the version of the bootloader to be used.

3. **C_COMP_PATH**: This setting specifies the path to the C compiler. It can be modified to point to a different compiler or version.

4. **OPT_TYPE**: This setting controls the type of compilation to be performed. It can be set to one of three values:
   - **0**: Optimize for profiling
   - **1**: Optimize for debugging (default)
   - **2**: Optimize for release

Depending on the value of **OPT_TYPE**, the corresponding optimization strategy will be used during compilation. The **OPT_STR** variable is set accordingly to reflect the chosen optimization strategy.

By modifying these settings in the **Settings.mk** file, developers can customize the build process to suit their specific requirements, such as targeting different hardware platforms or optimizing for performance, debugging, or release."

 Question:  What compiler options can be configured using the OPT_TYPE setting?","The OPT_TYPE setting configures the compiler options to predefined values for code optimizations and debugging symbols. Specifically, you can select one of two options:

1. **Debugging**: By setting OPT_TYPE to 1, you can configure the compiler for debugging purposes. This allows you to generate debugging symbols, which are essential for identifying and fixing errors in your code.

2. **Release build**: By setting OPT_TYPE to 2, you can configure the compiler for a release build. This optimizes the code for performance, size, and other factors, making it suitable for deployment in a production environment.

If you need to specify additional compiler or linker options, you should refer to the TI ARM Code Generation Tools manuals for more information."

 Question:  What is the purpose of the APDB structure in the application?","The purpose of the APDB (Application Descriptor Block) structure in the application is to provide a 128-byte structure that is used by download tools and the bootloader to update the application and perform CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) checks. This structure is essential for the proper functioning of the application, as it enables the download tools and bootloader to verify the integrity of the application code and ensure that it is correctly updated.

In other words, the APDB structure serves as a metadata container that provides information about the application, which is then utilized by the download tools and bootloader to manage the application's lifecycle, including updating and verifying its integrity. This is a critical aspect of the application's design, as it ensures that the code is reliable, trustworthy, and functions as intended.

The APDB structure is defined by the `Apdb_t` structure, which is a crucial component of the application's architecture. By including the APDB structure in the application, developers can ensure that their code is properly managed and maintained, which is essential for building robust and reliable systems.

In the context of the provided code examples and figures, the APDB structure is referenced in Figure 5.15, which shows the inclusion of the `IO_Driver.h` and `APDB.h` header files. These header files contain the necessary definitions and declarations for the APDB structure, which is then utilized in the application's code.

Overall, the APDB structure plays a vital role in the application's design, ensuring that the code is properly managed, updated, and verified, which is essential for building reliable and trustworthy systems."

This section shows a basic example. Section 5.7.1 on this page shows how to build the application with CCS. Section 5.7.2 on page 27 shows the code with some overview comments about the code structure. For more information, see Section 5.7.3 on page 30, Section 5.7.4 on page 30, and Section 5.7.5 on page 32.

 Question:  What is the recommended tool for code generation, according to the context?","According to the context, the recommended tool for code generation is the **TI ARM Code Generation Tools**. This is explicitly stated in the context, specifically in the section related to the **C_COMP_PATH** variable, which tells the **Makefile** what compiler to use. The context notes that the **TI ARM Code Generation Tools** are the only ones recommended by TTControl GmbH."
"You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the context that the user gives to answer the question. Treat the context as your internal knowledge, hence do not explicitly mention the ""context"" in your answer like ""Based on the provided context..."".If your answer relates to any image description given below, you should refer explicitly to the image ID in your answer with the format [image_id.png].Give a long and detailed answer.","Context: Remarks
- **A channel that is initialized with this function can retrieve frequency and duty cycle by**
calling the function: **IO_PWD_ComplexGet()**
- The timing measurement for channels IO_PWD_00 .. IO_PWD_05 **is based on a 27bit**
timer with a resolution of 0.5 us, therefore the period that shall be measured must be smaller than 67.108.863 us (∼ **67 s).**
- The timing measurement for channels IO_PWD_06 .. IO_PWD_11 **is hardware limited to**
10.000.000 us (= 10 s) with a resolution of 0.5 us. Because those timers work in an accumulating fashion the product of the measured period and the capture_count **must** be below this time.

10.000.000 us (= 10 s) with a resolution of 1 us. <chunk_seperator> ## 5.7.4 Linking Constant Data

Constant data is linked to the application region by default. However, it can also be linked to the external flash memory (if available) or to the application configuration data region. The major difference is the integrity protection of their respective contents. While constant data linked to the external flash memory is protected by the application CRC, the application configuration data region's integrity must be ensured by the application itself. Figure 5.19 on the facing page depicts an example of how to link constant data to the external flash memory as well as to the application configuration data region.

For safety-critical applications, every safety-critical IO pin can be initialized with a safety configuration. Please refer to **HY-TTC_500_Series_C_API_Manual.chm** [4] for further details.

To enable any outputs, the I/O Driver has to be configured with a valid safety configuration. The I/O Driver safety configuration consists of several elements:
- **command_period [**µs]: Sets the period at which the application cycle is executed.

Important: The **command_period** is checked by the watchdog and has to meet the window configuration.

- **window_size [%]**: Configures the size of the window for the watchdog which checks the command_period. The application cycle has to fulfill those timing requirements. <chunk_seperator> 0,1 % de la plage de mesure différentielle. <chunk_seperator> nal flash

 Question:  What type of protection does the application CRC provide to constant data linked to the external flash memory?","The application CRC provides integrity protection to constant data linked to the external flash memory. This means that any modification to the constant data linked to the external flash memory will lead to an invalid application CRC. The application CRC ensures that the data stored in the external flash memory remains unchanged and intact, preventing any unauthorized or accidental alterations. This is particularly important for safety-critical applications where data integrity is paramount."

Constant data is linked to the application region by default. However, it can also be linked to the external flash memory (if available) or to the application configuration data region. The major difference is the integrity protection of their respective contents. While constant data linked to the external flash memory is protected by the application CRC, the application configuration data region's integrity must be ensured by the application itself. Figure 5.19 on the facing page depicts an example of how to link constant data to the external flash memory as well as to the application configuration data region.

 Question:  What is the purpose of the **command_period** element in the I/O Driver safety configuration, and what checks its value?","The purpose of the **command_period** element in the I/O Driver safety configuration is to set the period at which the application cycle is executed. In other words, it determines the duration of each cycle in the safety-critical application. 

In this specific case, the duration of each cycle is 10000 µs, as mentioned earlier. This value is crucial because it is checked by the watchdog, which ensures that the application cycle meets the timing requirements defined by the **window_size** configuration. 

The watchdog plays a vital role in safety-critical applications, as it monitors the application's execution and triggers an error if the cycle duration deviates from the expected value. This mechanism prevents the application from malfunctioning or entering an unsafe state. 

Therefore, the **command_period** element is essential in the I/O Driver safety configuration, as it directly affects the reliability and safety of the application."

For safety-critical applications, every safety-critical IO pin can be initialized with a safety configuration. Please refer to **HY-TTC_500_Series_C_API_Manual.chm** [4] for further details.

To enable any outputs, the I/O Driver has to be configured with a valid safety configuration. The I/O Driver safety configuration consists of several elements:
- **command_period [**µs]: Sets the period at which the application cycle is executed.

Important: The **command_period** is checked by the watchdog and has to meet the window configuration.

- **window_size [%]**: Configures the size of the window for the watchdog which checks the command_period. The application cycle has to fulfill those timing requirements. <chunk_seperator> 0,1 % de la plage de mesure différentielle. <chunk_seperator> nal flash

It provides a short overview of the available I/O driver functions as well as detailed descriptions of those functions, including parameters, return values and examples.

## 5.7.4 Linking Constant Data <chunk_seperator> chargées de la mise en service, ainsi qu'au personnel de maintenance et de réparation ayant les connaissances correspondantes dans le domaine de l'automatisation industrielle, notamment dans les systèmes de bus CAN. Avant de connecter l'HMG 4000 sur un système de bus CAN opérationnel, il faut, selon le type et la topologie du système de bus CAN, ainsi que le mode de connexion, effectuer les préréglages et spécifications de paramètres correspondants sur l'HMG 4000. Une connexion de l'HMG 4000 avec des préréglages erronés sur un système de bus CAN actif peut provoquer des perturbations ou une défaillance du bus, ainsi que des dysfonctionnements, et aboutir à des dommages matériels 
(machine et installation) et corporels. 

Dans cette application, les capteurs standard CAN (p.ex. HDA 4000, HPT 1000) ou les capteurs intelligents CAN HYDAC (par ex. HPT 1000S, ETS 4000S) peuvent être lus et programmés de manière conviviale.
 Question:  What is the difference in integrity protection between constant data linked to the external flash memory and the application configuration data region?","The difference in integrity protection between constant data linked to the external flash memory and the application configuration data region lies in the way their contents are protected.

When constant data is linked to the external flash memory, its integrity is protected by the application CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check). This means that any modification to the data stored in the external flash memory will lead to an invalid application CRC, ensuring the data's integrity.

On the other hand, when constant data is linked to the application configuration data region, its integrity must be ensured by the application itself. This means that the application is responsible for protecting the data stored in the configuration data region, and there is no built-in protection mechanism like the application CRC.

In other words, the external flash memory provides a built-in integrity protection mechanism through the application CRC, whereas the application configuration data region relies on the application to ensure the integrity of its contents. This difference in integrity protection is crucial when deciding where to link constant data, depending on the specific requirements of the application."

The Lauterbach product TRACE32-ICD supports a wide range of on-chip debug interfaces. The hardware for the debugger is universal and allows interfacing different target processors by simply changing the debug cable and the software.
 Question:  How does the **reset_behavior** configuration handle errors in a safety-critical application?","The **reset_behavior** configuration handles errors in a safety-critical application by restarting the CPU in case of an error. If a safety-critical error occurs, the watchdog will reset the CPU and start again. After the maximum number of resets, a permanent safe state will be entered. This ensures that the system can recover from errors and maintain a safe state to prevent any potential harm or damage."

The Lauterbach product TRACE32-ICD supports a wide range of on-chip debug interfaces. The hardware for the debugger is universal and allows interfacing different target processors by simply changing the debug cable and the software.
 Question:  What is the purpose of the **TRACE32 Product Type** page during the installation of the Lauterbach Debugging Device?","The purpose of the **TRACE32 Product Type** page during the installation of the Lauterbach Debugging Device is to select the type of product or feature that the user wants to install. In this specific case, the user needs to select **Debugger** as the product type. This page is part of the installation wizard that guides the user through the installation process.

On this page, the user is presented with options to choose from, and the selection of **Debugger** indicates that the user wants to install the debugging feature of the Lauterbach Debugging Device. This feature is likely used for debugging and testing safety-critical applications, such as the HY-TTC 500 device.

By selecting **Debugger**, the user is configuring the installation to include the necessary components and tools for debugging and testing purposes. This is an important step in the installation process, as it determines the functionality and capabilities of the Lauterbach Debugging Device.

It is worth noting that the Lauterbach Debugging Device is a powerful tool that supports a wide range of on-chip debug interfaces, making it a versatile solution for debugging and testing various target processors. The installation process, including the **TRACE32 Product Type** page, ensures that the user can configure the device to meet their specific needs and requirements."

 Question:  What is the purpose of the FPGA, and what does it mean when it is configured or not configured?","The Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is a crucial electronic component in the given context. Its primary purpose is to function as a programmable digital circuit that can be reconfigured multiple times. This implies that the FPGA can be programmed to execute diverse digital tasks, making it a highly versatile and valuable component in various electronic devices and systems.

When the DONE LED is ON, it signifies that the FPGA is not configured. This means the FPGA has not been programmed or loaded with a specific digital task or function. Conversely, when the DONE LED is OFF, it indicates that the FPGA is configured, implying that it has been successfully programmed and is ready to execute its assigned digital task.

In essence, the FPGA's configuration status, as indicated by the DONE LED, determines its ability to perform specific digital functions. When not configured, the FPGA remains in a dormant state, awaiting programming or configuration. Once configured, it becomes an active component, capable of executing its designated digital tasks."

You can download the TTC-Downloader tool from our Service Area:
1. Enter the **HY-TTC Downloader** page. 2. From there, enter the page with the latest release.

3. Download **Installer - TTC-Downloader <version>.zip**. 4. Extract the **.zip** file on your computer.

The tool comes with a documentation file **help.chm**. <chunk_seperator> After successful connection, the downloader will identify the device and prepare the flashing process (see Figure 5.48(b) on the facing page).

## 5.8.2.2.2 Connecting Via Ethernet

Note: For unexperienced users of the HY-TTC 500 it is recommended to use the CAN option. If you use Ethernet and an application is already flashed to the target, then you have to make sure that the application listens to download requests on the Ethernet. The example application of the Quick Start Guide does not listen to download requests.

To connect to the device via Ethernet, use the Ethernet port of your computer and connect it to the Ethernet port of the HY-TTC 500. Note that a point-to-point Ethernet connection is mandatory. Open the TTC-Downloader.

The next step depends on the content of the flash memory: <chunk_seperator> - If the target has an application or CODESYS runtime system flashed, then enter the correct Ethernet settings. If you do not know the correct Ethernet settings, please use CAN to connect with the target as described in Section 5.8.2.2.1 on page 45. To set the correct Ethernet settings, open the **Preferences** dialog box (e.g. with **Ctrl + P**), enter the values, and click **Apply**.

The diagram illustrated in [image_id.png] represents various layers of data storage and processing in the HY-TTC 500 system. There are four main sections in this diagram, each representing different levels of data handling.

Firstly, the top-left corner section is labeled ""Application,"" which likely refers to the application software or program that utilizes the data stored in the other sections. This layer is situated at the top-left corner of the image.

The second section, occupying a large portion of the middle area of the image, is labeled ""Data."" This layer indicates the storage and organization of raw data within the system, extending from the top-right to the bottom-left corner of the image.

The following table specifies the start address and size of the bootloader, FPGA IP, APDB, **application** and **application configuration data** for the HY-TTC 500 controllers. See also the file mem_ttc500_bl.lsf, which is delivered with the package.

Note: A compatible FPGA is delivered with the package. Note: The application configuration data region is not protected by the application CRC and thus, its integrity must be ensured by the application itself. For detailed information about modifying the flash memory, refer to the documentation **help.chm** for the TTC-Downloader, page **Modifying Flash/EEPROM Memory**.

 This symbol enables access to the measured values of channel settings. Tapping this symbol expands the function bar at the left of the screen, where short explanatory notes describe the function of each symbol. 

 This symbol opens a sub-function and in this particular case, opens up the channel range ""CAN-Bus/HCSI (K)"". After opening, a list of max. 28 single channels becomes available. 

Each single channel represents exactly one *Signal or process value*, which generally corresponds with only one section of a *PDO message***. Each channel can be activated separately and configured individually.**
