Question:  What type of measurement is performed by the SSZ frequency/pulse width measurement and edge/incremental counter?","The SSZ frequency/pulse width measurement and edge/incremental counter performs a type of measurement related to frequency and pulse width, which is typically used in digital electronics and signal processing applications. 

In this context, the frequency measurement is likely related to the frequency of a digital signal, whereas the pulse width measurement is concerned with the duration of a digital pulse. The edge/incremental counter is a type of digital counter that increments its count on the rising or falling edge of a digital signal, allowing it to measure the frequency or pulse width of the signal.

This type of measurement is often used in applications such as signal processing, digital communication systems, and microcontroller-based systems, where the frequency and pulse width of digital signals need to be accurately measured and processed."

Question:  What is the purpose of the IO_PWD_GetCurrent() function, as mentioned in the 1.4.0 section?","The purpose of the IO_PWD_GetCurrent() function, as mentioned in the 1.4.0 section, is to be called with safe current PWD inputs. This implies that the function is responsible for retrieving the current state or value of the Power-Down (PWD) inputs, ensuring that these inputs are safe and valid. This function is likely used in the context of failure diagnostics and safety mechanisms, as it is mentioned alongside other issues related to safety parameters, FMEDA values, and safety switches."

## 4.2.5 Low-Voltage Operation
Question:  What were the issues 106526, 116787, 117070, and 116664 about, and what were the results of these issues?","Issues 106526, 116787, 117070, and 116664 were related to the development and improvement of a hardware metrics guideline.

Issue 106526 was about adding new variants HY-TTC 510 and HY-TTC 520. As a result, hardware metrics were separately listed for each variant, and respective pins were added.

Issue 116787 was related to CAN Termination and CAN Interface 3-6 being separately listed in the Guideline on Hardware Metrics. This change led to an update in the metrics for these interfaces.

Issue 117070 was about correcting calculations and respective metrics for functional blocks without any diagnostic measures. This correction led to an update of the PCB failure rate distribution and, therefore, new metrics for nearly each functional block. The affected blocks included PVG Output, LIN Interface, RS232 Interface, CAN Interface 0-6, CAN Termination, Real Time Clock, and timer input 6-11.

Issue 116664 was about adding overall safety information. As a result, this information was added to the guideline.

In summary, these issues were related to improving the accuracy and completeness of the hardware metrics guideline, adding new variants, and correcting calculations and metrics for various functional blocks. The results of these issues were updated metrics, added information, and improved accuracy in the guideline."

The I/O driver's diagnostic module continuously compares the desired output status with the feedback measurements, thus allowing to detect failures within the digital low side output stages. This measure is active for every pair of digital high side output and digital low side output that is initialized as safetycritical and will trigger an error callback in case of dangerous failures.

If the digital low side output is not configured safety-critical—and thus, is not used in combination with a digital high side output—no safety measures are executed by the I/O driver's diagnostic modules.

## Analog Input:

The digital low side stages' analog input measurement is not equipped with automatically enabled safety mechanisms. Therefore, no safety mechanisms can be claimed by the system integrator and additional measures have to be enabled, if the overall safety function requires diagnostic coverage for the analog input function.

Question:  What is the purpose of the safety lifecycle as described in section 2?","The purpose of the safety lifecycle, as described in section 2, is to ensure the safety of systems and components throughout their entire lifecycle, from development to operation and maintenance. This is achieved by identifying and mitigating potential hazards and risks, and by implementing safety measures and controls to prevent or minimize harm to people, the environment, and assets.

The safety lifecycle, as outlined in section 2, encompasses various stages, including:

1. Hazard identification and risk assessment: Identifying potential hazards and assessing the risks associated with them.
2. Safety requirement specification: Defining safety requirements and specifications for the system or component.
3. Design and development: Designing and developing the system or component to meet the safety requirements.
4. Testing and validation: Testing and validating the system or component to ensure it meets the safety requirements.
5. Production and operation: Producing and operating the system or component in a safe manner.
6. Maintenance and repair: Maintaining and repairing the system or component to ensure continued safe operation.

The safety lifecycle is guided by international standards, such as IEC 61508, ISO 13849, and ISO 25119, which provide frameworks and guidelines for ensuring safety in the development and operation of systems and components.

By following the safety lifecycle, organizations can ensure that their systems and components are designed, developed, and operated in a safe and reliable manner, minimizing the risk of accidents, injuries, and damage to the environment and assets."

Question:  What is a safety function, as defined in section 3.1.1?","According to section 3.1.1, a Safety Function is a specific function that is designed to prevent or mitigate hazards in a system. This function is typically implemented in safety-critical systems to ensure that the system operates within a safe state, even in the presence of faults or errors.

In the context of safety-critical systems, a Safety Function is a crucial component that helps to maintain the safety of the system, its users, and the environment. It is a specific function that is designed to prevent or mitigate hazards, and it is typically implemented in systems that have safety-critical components.

For example, in a power supply system, a Safety Function might be a function that monitors the output voltage and current to prevent overvoltage or overcurrent conditions that could damage the system or cause harm to users. In a motor control system, a Safety Function might be a function that monitors the motor speed and position to prevent overspeed or loss of control that could cause accidents.

In summary, a Safety Function, as defined in section 3.1.1, is a specific function that is designed to prevent or mitigate hazards in a system, and it is a crucial component of safety-critical systems."

Question:  What is the purpose of the failure diagnostics process, as described in section 5.4?","The purpose of the failure diagnostics process, as described in section 5.4, is to detect and diagnose errors or faults in the system. This process is an essential part of the safety lifecycle, as it enables the system to identify and respond to failures in a timely and effective manner. 

The failure diagnostics process is designed to detect errors or faults in the system, and then initiate the necessary failure reaction to prevent or mitigate the consequences of the failure. This process is critical in ensuring the safety and reliability of the system, as it allows the system to take corrective action to prevent or minimize the impact of a failure. 

In the context of safety-critical systems, the failure diagnostics process plays a vital role in maintaining the safe state of the system. By detecting and diagnosing errors or faults, the system can take prompt action to prevent or mitigate the consequences of a failure, thereby ensuring the safety of users and preventing potential harm."

The I/O driver's diagnostic module continuously compares the desired output status with the feedback measurements, thus allowing to detect failures within the digital low side output stages. This measure is active for every pair of digital high side output and digital low side output that is initialized as safetycritical and will trigger an error callback in case of dangerous failures.

If the digital low side output is not configured safety-critical—and thus, is not used in combination with a digital high side output—no safety measures are executed by the I/O driver's diagnostic modules.

## Analog Input:

The digital low side stages' analog input measurement is not equipped with automatically enabled safety mechanisms. Therefore, no safety mechanisms can be claimed by the system integrator and additional measures have to be enabled, if the overall safety function requires diagnostic coverage for the analog input function.

Question:  What is the purpose of the hardware metrics determination guideline, as described in section 8?","The purpose of the hardware metrics determination guideline, as described in section 8, is to provide a framework for determining the reliability and safety of hardware components in a system. This guideline outlines the steps and considerations for evaluating the Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) values of functional blocks, which is essential for ensuring the safety and reliability of the overall system.

The guideline is divided into several subsections, each focusing on a specific aspect of hardware metrics determination. For instance，subsection 8.1 provides an overview of the MTTF values for different functional blocks，such as HY-TTC 508，HY-TTC 510，HY-TTC 520，HY-TTC 580，and HY-TTC 590/HY-TTC 590E. These values are crucial for evaluating the reliability of the hardware components and ensuring that they meet the required safety standards.

Additionally，the guideline covers failure diagnostics (subsection 8.2) and provides information on combined safety mechanisms (subsection 8.2.1)，CORE (subsection 8。2。2)，and various sensor supplies and input stages (subsections 8。2。3 to 8。2。11).

The ultimate goal of this guideline is to ensure that the hardware components are designed and tested to meet the required safety and reliability standards，thus minimizing the risk of failures and ensuring the overall safety of the system."

Question:  What kind of defects can be expected in software development, and what is the current state of the art in science and technology regarding this?","Based on the provided legal disclaimer, it is acknowledged that despite taking great care and attention, it is impossible to develop software that is completely free of defects in all applications. This implies that software development is inherently prone to errors, bugs, or defects, which can arise from various factors such as human mistakes, complexity, or unforeseen interactions.

The current state of the art in science and technology regarding software development suggests that it is a challenging task to create flawless software. This is because software development involves intricate processes, multiple variables, and complex interactions, making it difficult to anticipate and eliminate all potential defects.

In this context, defects can manifest in various forms, such as:

1. Functional defects: Errors or bugs that affect the software's functionality, causing it to malfunction or produce incorrect results.
2. Performance defects: Issues that impact the software's performance, leading to slow execution, crashes, or freezes.
3. Security defects: Vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers, compromising the software's security and potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized access.
4. Compatibility defects: Problems that arise when the software is used in conjunction with other systems, hardware, or software, causing incompatibilities or conflicts.

Given the complexity of software development, it is essential to acknowledge that defects can occur, and it is the responsibility of the system integrator to immediately contact TTControl if any malfunctioning or uncertainties regarding the HY-TTC 500 platform arise contrary to specifications."

Category: Comment ID: 586694 The **HY-TTC 500 platform** provides a user programmable general purpose ECU, intended for usage in safety-critical environments. It consists of:
- the HY-TTC 500 hardware platform
- the bootloader containing the start-up code for the Main CPU - Diagnostic software executed by the Main CPU
- I/O drivers for reading sensor data and controlling actuators The term **system** refers to the final system (e.g. vehicle, machine …) in which the HY-TTC 500 platform is integrated.

The term **safety-critical system** refers to a system whose failure or malfunction may result in death or injury.

The **system integrator** defines and develops the system and integrates the HY-TTC 500 into the system. The system integrator is responsible for the safe operation of the full system. <chunk_seperator> Category: Requirement Label: ID: 3065953 Related To: Related To':
To guarantee proper safety integrity the device **shall** not be used after the maximum lifetime of 20 years.

Category: Comment ID: 3065955 After a lifetime of 20 years, the device's probabilistic metrics cannot be seen as constant anymore (failure rates, PFH) and therefore the targeted Performance (PL) and Safety Integrity Level (SIL) cannot be guaranteed. For this reason, operating a device in a safety critical application after 20 years is in full responsibility of the system integrator.

Category: Requirement Label: Contact_Support ID: 729965 Related To: Related To':

[TTC500-SM-26262] addon.

Category: Comment ID: 4572941 The HY-TTC 500 platform allows the system integrator to realize mixed criticality applications (applications containing safe and unsafe code).

Therefore, mechanisms for temporal and spatial separation have been considered during development. Temporal separation is already ensured by design, but spatial separation needs to be implemented by the application software (see section '*Memory Protection Unit*'). <chunk_seperator> <table_154>[{'Pin No.': 'Function', 'SW-define': 'Power stage'}, {'-----------': '-----------------------------------', '-------------': '---------------'}, {'P161': 'High-Side Digital Output/PVG/VOUT', 'IO_PVG_00': 'a'}, {'P185': 'High-Side Digital Output/PVG/VOUT', 'IO_PVG_01': 'a'}, {'P188': 'High-Side Digital Output/PVG/VOUT', 'IO_PVG_02': 'b'}, {'P164': 'High-Side Digital Output/PVG/VOUT', 'IO_PVG_03': 'b'}, {'P191': 'High-Side Digital Output/PVG/VOUT', 'IO_PVG_04': 'c'}, {'P167': 'High-Side Digital Output/PVG/VOUT', 'IO_PVG_05': 'c'}, {'P194': 'High-Side Digital Output/PVG/VOUT', 'IO_PVG_06': 'd'}, {'P170': 'High-Side Digital Output/PVG/VOUT', 'IO_PVG_07': 'd'}]</table_154>

Temporal separation is already ensured by design, but spatial separation needs to be implemented by the application software (see section '*Memory Protection Unit*'). <chunk_seperator> <table_154>[{'Pin No.': 'Function', 'SW-define': 'Power stage'}, {'-----------': '-----------------------------------', '-------------': '---------------'}, {'P161': 'High-Side Digital Output/PVG/VOUT', 'IO_PVG_00': 'a'}, {'P185': 'High-Side Digital Output/PVG/VOUT', 'IO_PVG_01': 'a'}, {'P188': 'High-Side Digital Output/PVG/VOUT', 'IO_PVG_02': 'b'}, {'P164': 'High-Side Digital Output/PVG/VOUT', 'IO_PVG_03': 'b'}, {'P191': 'High-Side Digital Output/PVG/VOUT', 'IO_PVG_04': 'c'}, {'P167': 'High-Side Digital Output/PVG/VOUT', 'IO_PVG_05': 'c'}, {'P194': 'High-Side Digital Output/PVG/VOUT', 'IO_PVG_06': 'd'}, {'P170': 'High-Side Digital Output/PVG/VOUT', 'IO_PVG_07': 'd'}]</table_154>

All eight outputs can be configured independently of each other. <chunk_seperator> For the documentation of the I/O drivers, including information on how to use these drivers in safety related applications, refer to the HY-TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM], Part II: Software Description. Check the release notes for known issues and their impact on the ECU's functions.

The HY-TTC 500 platform cannot guarantee safe operation of the system as a whole. Therefore, certain requirements and constraints have to be fulfilled by the application software as described in this document. Also, a functional safety assessment has to be conducted for the final system according to the system's applicable standards and norms.

Category: Comment ID: 586702 The HY-TTC 500 platform fulfills the requirements of the following safety standards and their assigned safety/performance levels:
- ISO 13849 Category 2, Performance Level d. - IEC 61508 Safety Integrity Level 2.

- ISO 25119 AgPL d/SRL 2.

use is defined by the """". Devices meeting the requirements of a device profile, sometimes provide additional event types. For example, the CiA 404 ""Device profile for measuring devices"" offers the opportunity to trigger the sending of a TPDO when a measured value has been exceeded. If a device offers additional event variants, these are described in chapter 3.6.3 *device-specific PDO* 
events. In case the event-controlled transmission of the PDO and the *Event timer***(ET) are active,** 
the PDO will be transmitted after expiry of the ""event time"" at the latest, if no other device event has occurred.

## 2 Safety Lifecycle - - -

Category: Comment ID: 586714 Due to the HY-TTC 500 platform's nature of being a generic control unit for diverse safety-critical applications, the execution of the IEC 61508, ISO 13849 and ISO 25119 safety lifecycle phases are based on specific assumptions for the overall system. These assumptions are listed within the following document and need to be considered by the system integrator. <chunk_seperator> Note 1: The item *Core* contains the HY-TTC 500 platform's integral logic components (e.g. internal power supply or Main CPU) and is vital to the ECU's general function. Therefore, its failure rate has to be added to every individual safety function, regardless of the utilized set of functional blocks. Note 2: The item *Transient Core Failures* includes the Main CPU's soft errors. These failures are typically only applicable to metrics calculations based on IEC 61508. <chunk_seperator> Category: Comment ID: 3074044 The following subsections list the corresponding safety lifecycle phases and/or activities partly (e.g. 

overall system phases only applied on ECU level, ...) or completely considered in the course of the HYTTC 500 platform development. Caused by the platforms nature, only a subset of phases/activities have been applied to the HY-TTC 500 which means all other lifecycle phases/activities have to be considered in the course of the system development by the system integrator. Although a phase/activity has already been considered on HY-TTC 500 ECU level, it does not mean that it is not also relevant for the system integrator on system level.

Category: Comment ID: 586823 In the safe state, no current will be applied to the safety-critical outputs of the ECU, i.e. in case of an error the safety-critical outputs will be switched off.

Question:  What are the two main components of the HY-TTC 500 platform that enable its use in safety-critical applications?","The two main components of the HY-TTC 500 platform that enable its use in safety-critical applications are the **ECU hardware** and the **safety software functions**.

The ECU hardware component consists of a Main CPU and a Safety Companion acting as an external watchdog, which provides a fail-safe mechanism to ensure the safe operation of the system. This hardware component is designed to meet the requirements of safety-critical applications.

The safety software functions, on the other hand, include the bootloader, board support package (BSP), FPGA bitstream, and I/O driver library. These software components work together to provide a safe and reliable operation of the system. The bootloader ensures the correct loading and execution of the application software, while the BSP provides the necessary start-up code for the Main CPU. The FPGA bitstream is used to obtain certain feedback values of safety-critical outputs, and the I/O driver library provides a safe interface between the application software and the HY-TTC 500 safety platform.

Together, these two main components of the HY-TTC 500 platform enable its use in safety-critical applications, where reliability and fault tolerance are paramount."

## 9.2.3 Digital Switches

Category: Comment ID: 592099 Digital switches that statically emit logical high or low levels, do not provide any measures for detection of potential failures, typically. Thus, the system integrator has to redundantly utilize two separate inputs when requiring safety-critical inputs. The application software is responsible for comparing the measurements and change to the safe state in case of discrepancies between both input values.

Category: Comment ID: 592101 During operation, redundantly used digital switches may show a certain offset regarding their actual switching threshold. Consequently, there may be a particular time period where the comparison of the sensors' input values appears to be implausible. The system integrator is advised to provide adequate debouncing of those intermediate states within the application software.

If a high-side output is not needed on IO_PWM_00 - IO_PWM_35, **the loop-back path of these** output stages can be alternatively used as a digital or frequency input. External switches which are directly switching to battery voltage must not be used with alternative inputs. See Section 6.6 on page 218 **for more information on using the alternative digital and frequency** input function of the High-Side PWM Outputs.

## 9.2.3 Digital Switches

Category: Comment ID: 592099 Digital switches that statically emit logical high or low levels, do not provide any measures for detection of potential failures, typically. Thus, the system integrator has to redundantly utilize two separate inputs when requiring safety-critical inputs. The application software is responsible for comparing the measurements and change to the safe state in case of discrepancies between both input values.

Category: Comment ID: 592101 During operation, redundantly used digital switches may show a certain offset regarding their actual switching threshold. Consequently, there may be a particular time period where the comparison of the sensors' input values appears to be implausible. The system integrator is advised to provide adequate debouncing of those intermediate states within the application software.

Therefore for the provided functions and the respective pins of the respective variant please see HY-TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM]. <chunk_seperator> Category: Comment ID: 590202 The HY-TTC 500 platform's PWM stages are allocated to three different shut-off groups that feature separate shut-off paths, each. Thus—in case of certain failures—the application software can deenergize the one group with the erroneous PWM output, while keeping the remaining two groups operational. That way, the system integrator may implement a limp-home function which allows the system to run in a reduced mode, e.g. for returning to the workshop for repair.

Category: Requirement Label: Shutoff_Allocation ID: 590192 Related To: 320067 Related To':
If the system integrator independently controls the separate shut-off groups in case of failures, the actuators **shall** be allocated to the groups in such a way that does not introduce dangerous situations in reduced operation mode.

## 3.1.3 Safety-Critical System Components
Question:  Why are certain components, such as 5V sensor supplies, not recommended to be used as safety-critical components unless the system integrator's application can provide the required diagnostic measures?","The reason certain components, such as 5V sensor supplies, are not recommended to be used as safety-critical components unless the system integrator's application can provide the required diagnostic measures is due to the lack of necessary diagnostic capabilities in these components.

According to the provided information, the HY-TTC 500 platform's PWM stages are allocated to three different shut-off groups that feature separate shut-off paths, each. This allows the system integrator to implement a limp-home function, which enables the system to run in a reduced mode, for instance, for returning to the workshop for repair, in case of certain failures. However, for diagnostic reasons, a minimum duty cycle is always applied to the safety-critical PWM stages as long as the CPU is in the state *Main*. This means that even if the application deliberately deactivates the corresponding outputs, the PWM stages will still be operational to some extent.

In the context of safety-critical system components, it is essential to ensure that these components do not introduce hazardous conditions in case of a failure or malfunction. The HY-TTC 500 defines certain components as being safety-critical if any of the ECU's functions is used in a safety-critical application. These components include the Main CPU, Safety Companion, Power supply, internal supply voltages, and Internal temperature.

Furthermore, the HY-TTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules can detect dangerous failures within certain functional blocks. These functional blocks include 5V sensor supplies, analog-to-digital converters, digital timer inputs, high side PWM outputs, digital high side outputs, and digital low side outputs.

The requirement is that if, for a given application, the value read from an analog or digital input is used for determining the set value of a safety-critical output, then this input shall also be defined as safety-critical. This implies that the system integrator must ensure that the necessary diagnostic measures are in place to detect any potential failures within these safety-critical components.

In conclusion, certain components, such as 5V sensor supplies, are not recommended to be used as safety-critical components unless the system integrator's application can provide the required diagnostic measures. This is because these components lack the necessary diagnostic capabilities to detect potential failures, which could lead to hazardous conditions in case of a malfunction."

Category: Comment ID: 723236 An error is classified as being non-fatal, if its occurrence does not prevent the safe program execution, per se. That may be because the error is clearly related to a contained subsystem of the ECU (e.g. an analog input stage) or the error is located outside of the ECU (e.g. an open circuit of a safety-critical actuator).

Non-fatal errors do not directly lead to the safe state. Instead, the I/O-driver diagnostics will execute the application-specific error callback, if it has been correctly passed during the driver initialization.

Category: Comment ID: 723224 An error is classified as being fatal, if a safe program execution is not possible anymore, regardless of the actual application. The following errors are characterized as being fatal:
- errors that are fatal in their consequence, so that an anti-glitch strategy is not feasible (e.g. RAM or register errors, safe state activation by the Safety Companion)
- temporary errors that persist over the anti-glitch time For fatal errors, the HY-TTC 500 platform's failure reaction is to enter the safe state immediately. If the according notification callback is configured, the application software will be notified by the I/O-driver diagnostics.

## - - - 3.1.4 Failure Reaction In Case Of Errors -

Category: Comment ID: 723213 The HY-TTC 500 platform distinguishes between different errors with regards to the momentary failure reaction. Depending on the type of error, the I/O-driver's diagnostic modules will initiate specific actions. The following section describes those types of errors and the according HY-TTC 500 platform's behavior. A detailed failure classification into the different error types can be found in the I/O driver API within the TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM], Part II: Software Development.

## 3.1.4.1 Fatal Errors
Question:  What happens to temporary errors that persist over the specified glitch filter time on the HY-TTC 500 platform?","According to the HY-TTC 500 platform's failure reaction, if a temporary error persists over the specified glitch filter time, it may either turn into a fatal error or a non-fatal error, depending on its consequence."

A typical driving cycle (i.e. the time between power-up and power-down of the ECU) **shall** not exceed 24 hours.

Category: Comment ID: 586825 The term 'typical driving cycle' describes the time interval between power-up and power-down, a vehicle is designed for. That means, driving cycles of more than 24 hours shall only happen on rare occasions and are to be exercised with the utmost caution, as the safety related tests performed upon start-up are no longer executed with the specified proof test interval.

Due to the fact, that a number of diagnostics is only performed during system start-up, the typical driving cycle is considered to be equal to the proof test interval. <chunk_seperator> ## - 3.1.5.1 Core Failure Reaction Time - -

Category: Comment ID: 813067 The effective reaction time of the core's diagnostics is based on the following parameters that can be adjusted during the I/O driver initialization call:
- Command period, i.e. the so-called cycle time (*t_cycle*): 1 … 50 ms
- Glitch filter time (*t_glitch*): 1 … 180 ms In addition, the external watchdog window time (*t_wd*) is defined to be 64 ms.

The configured glitch filter time correlates with the selected cycle time. Each specific failure diagnostic will be executed every sixth application cycle. Under worst case conditions, the applied glitch filter time will therefore increase to the next higher integer multiple of 6 * t_cycle. <chunk_seperator> t_glitch_effective = round_to_multiple(t_glitch, 6*t_cycle)
Subsequently, the calculation of the core's effective worst case failure reaction time is as follows: wc_frt_core = max(((6+1) * t_cycle) + t_glitch_effective, t_wd) 
As a result, the core's calculated worst case failure reaction time can lie between 64 ms and 650 ms according to the safety parameters chosen by the application software.

Category: Comment ID: 813423 Specific properties of the input and output stages (and their related signals) might contribute to the overall worst case failure reaction time for a given safety function, as well.

For the overall worst case failure reaction time, the system integrator typically has to add up the worst case failure reaction times of the core and the worst case failure reaction time for the input and output stages (i.e. the single input or output stage type that has the greatest influence). <chunk_seperator> ## 3.1.6.2 Probabilistic Values For Iec 61508 -

A typical driving cycle (i.e. the time between power-up and power-down of the ECU) **shall** not exceed 24 hours.

Category: Comment ID: 586825 The term 'typical driving cycle' describes the time interval between power-up and power-down, a vehicle is designed for. That means, driving cycles of more than 24 hours shall only happen on rare occasions and are to be exercised with the utmost caution, as the safety related tests performed upon start-up are no longer executed with the specified proof test interval.

Due to the fact, that a number of diagnostics is only performed during system start-up, the typical driving cycle is considered to be equal to the proof test interval. <chunk_seperator> ## - 3.1.5.1 Core Failure Reaction Time - -

Category: Comment ID: 813067 The effective reaction time of the core's diagnostics is based on the following parameters that can be adjusted during the I/O driver initialization call:
- Command period, i.e. the so-called cycle time (*t_cycle*): 1 … 50 ms
- Glitch filter time (*t_glitch*): 1 … 180 ms In addition, the external watchdog window time (*t_wd*) is defined to be 64 ms.

The configured glitch filter time correlates with the selected cycle time. Each specific failure diagnostic will be executed every sixth application cycle. Under worst case conditions, the applied glitch filter time will therefore increase to the next higher integer multiple of 6 * t_cycle. <chunk_seperator> t_glitch_effective = round_to_multiple(t_glitch, 6*t_cycle)
Subsequently, the calculation of the core's effective worst case failure reaction time is as follows: wc_frt_core = max(((6+1) * t_cycle) + t_glitch_effective, t_wd) 
As a result, the core's calculated worst case failure reaction time can lie between 64 ms and 650 ms according to the safety parameters chosen by the application software.

Category: Comment ID: 813423 Specific properties of the input and output stages (and their related signals) might contribute to the overall worst case failure reaction time for a given safety function, as well.

For the overall worst case failure reaction time, the system integrator typically has to add up the worst case failure reaction times of the core and the worst case failure reaction time for the input and output stages (i.e. the single input or output stage type that has the greatest influence). <chunk_seperator> ## 3.1.6.2 Probabilistic Values For Iec 61508 -

Question:  How is the effective glitch filter time (t_glitch_effective) calculated, and what is its value in the given example?","The effective glitch filter time (t_glitch_effective) is calculated as the round-to-multiple of the glitch filter time (t_glitch) to the cycle time (t_cycle). In the given example, t_glitch is 180 ms, and t_cycle is 1 ms. 

To calculate t_glitch_effective, we need to find a positive integer number n that fulfills n*6*t_cycle >= t_glitch. In this case, n must be 30, which results in 30*6*1 ms = 180 ms. 

Therefore, the effective glitch filter time (t_glitch_effective) is 180 ms."

An application software specifies the cycle time (*t_cycle*) to be 1 ms and the glitch filter time (*t_glitch*) to be 180 ms. A given safety function makes use of the following safety-related inputs and outputs: 
- 2 PWM high side outputs configured with an output frequency of 500 Hz and safety-relevant current measurement
- 2 timer inputs being used with a frequency of 10 Hz, each 
- 4 analog inputs The resulting worst case failure reaction time of the core can be calculated as follows: t_glitch_effective = round_to_multiple(180 ms, 6*1 ms) = 180 ms Note: *round_to_multiple* means to find a positive integer number n that fulfills *n*6*t_cycle >= t_glitch*.

Question:  What is the basis for the power supply limits of the HY-TTC 500 platform?","The basis for the power supply limits of the HY-TTC 500 platform is the probabilistic values calculated according to the requirements of IEC 61508, ISO 25119, and ISO 13849, respectively, for the system's required safety performance. These probabilistic values include PFH, SFF, MTTFd, and DCavg, which are determined by the system integrator. The system integrator shall verify that the probabilistic values of the overall system are within the limits specified in these standards for the system's required safety performance.

In particular, the probabilistic values for the HY-TTC 500 platform are provided in the tables [table_10], [table_11], [table_12], and [table_14]. These tables show the values for PFH, SFF, MTTFd, and DCavg, respectively, for different mission profiles (MP_Conventional and MP_Stop-Go). The system integrator shall rely on these probabilistic values to determine the power supply limits of the HY-TTC 500 platform.

For example, according to [table_10], for the mission profile MP_Conventional, the probabilistic values are PFH = 141 FIT, SFF = 98.50%, MTTFd = 68.55 years, and DCavg = 92.98%. These values form the basis for the power supply limits of the HY-TTC 500 platform.

Similarly, according to [table_11], for the mission profile MP_Stop-Go, the probabilistic values are PFH = 135 FIT, SFF = 98.55%, MTTFd = 69.50 years, and DCavg = 93.15%. These values also form the basis for the power supply limits of the HY-T-C 500 platform.

Therefore, the system integrator shall consider these probabilistic values when determining the power supply limits of the HY-T-C 500 platform to ensure safe operation."

1. Through the terminal 15 input (K15), which can be connected to the ignition key lock. When the ignition key is turned on, the ECU is activated.

2. Through the wake-up input, which can be connected to a secondary power-up source, such as the vehicle's door contact. When this input is turned on, the ECU is also activated.

Question:  What is the purpose of the power switch in the HY-TTC 500 platform, and what should it disconnect in addition to the ECU's logic unit?","In the HY-TTC 500 platform, the power switch serves a crucial purpose. Its primary function is to disconnect the ECU's logic unit from the power stage supply, ensuring a reliable shutdown of the system. This is particularly important in cases where an external short circuit occurs on the actuator lines. 

When the power switch is activated, it should disconnect the ECU's logic unit from the power stage supply, thereby preventing any potential damage to the system. This disconnection is essential to guarantee a safe and controlled shutdown of the ECU. 

In addition to disconnecting the ECU's logic unit, the power switch should also decouple both power supply rails from each other. This is necessary to prevent any backflow of power from one supply rail to the other, which could potentially cause harm to the system or lead to unpredictable behavior. 

By disconnecting the ECU's logic unit from the power stage supply and decoupling both power supply rails, the power switch ensures a safe and reliable shutdown of the HY-TTC 500 platform, even in the presence of external short circuits on the actuator lines. This configuration also prevents the possibility of a software-controlled after-run, as the system is fully shut down by the power switch."

One power supply connection is exclusively provided for the ECU's logic unit, while the other connection supplies the power stages. In addition, the ECU is equipped with two additional inputs for a power control function: In permanently supplied systems, the terminal 15 input (K15) may be connected with the ignition key lock, the wake up input (Wake-Up) may be connected to a secondary power up source (e.g. the vehicle's door contact). The ECU's activation is triggered, in case one of these inputs is turned on. After deactivating these signals, the ECU may continue to operate before autonomously powering down upon the application's shutdown request. Details about the terminal 15 and wake up inputs can be found in the TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM]. In case the software-controlled shutdown function via terminal 15 is not utilized (i.e., terminal 15 is tied to battery <chunk_seperator> Category: Comment ID: 591651 The following figure shows an **invalid** wiring example when using a power switch without terminal 15 utilization.

The following figure shows another **invalid** wiring example when using a power switch to concurrently disconnect terminal 15 and the supply for the internal power stages (BAT+ Power). In case of external short circuits in the actuator lines, the terminal 15 input might still be supplied via reverse conducting power stages, even if the power switch is activated.

In case the software-controlled shutdown function via terminal 15 is not utilized (i.e., terminal 15 is tied to battery voltage and the HY-TTC 500 platform's power supply is directly activated and deactivated by the operator), the system integrator is advised to provide the system operator with means to disconnect the ECU's logic unit from battery voltage. In order to allow reliable deactivation—even in case of an external load being shorted to battery voltage—the power switch (e.g. ignition key, circuit breaker …) is required to also disconnect the ECU's logic unit from the power stage supply rail.
Question:  What is the advantage of the valid wiring example shown in Figure 3, and what feature is not possible with this configuration?","The advantage of the valid wiring example shown in Figure 2 [35_image_0.png] is that it allows the power switch to de-energize the ECU's logic core and shut down the overall ECU in case of external short circuits on the actuator lines. This is because the power switch independently disconnects the supply for the internal logic core (BAT+ CPU) and also decouples both power supply rails from each other.

However, with this configuration, a software-controlled after-run is not possible. This means that the system cannot continue to operate for a short period of time after the shutdown request has been made, as the power switch will immediately disconnect the power supply to the ECU's logic core. This may be a limitation in certain applications where a controlled shutdown sequence is required."

Category: Comment ID: 592155 The following section describes the requirements for utilization of input stages in safety-critical environments. Whenever a requirement demands the redundant usage of specific inputs, this redundancy does only correspond to the HY-TTC 500 input stage. The sensor, however, may feature a single channel architecture, as long as it is connected to both used inputs, in parallel. Still, the system integrator is responsible for calculating the overall dangerous failure rate of the complete channel involved in the execution of a safety function. The redundancy of input stages may also be established by combining different types of input stages—as long as both of the utilized input types support the desired mode of operation.

Category: Comment ID: 592163 The digital timer inputs 0-5 (*IO_PWD_00* ... *IO_PWD_05*) provide the necessary diagnostic measures and are usable for safety-critical applications, when adhering to the requirements in the following section. The digital timer inputs 6-11 (*IO_PWD_06* ... *IO_PWD_11*) do not provide the same set of diagnostic measures and are therefore not usable for safety-critical applications without further restrictions. For details about their suitability, please refer to section *Guideline on Hardware Metrics Determination*. <chunk_seperator> ## Periodically

The term '*periodically*' or '*periodical*' within this documents refers for example to a frequently call of a function or a regular check of a state or variable. However, the 'periodically' condition is not related to certain time base, but to software cycles. Whenever something has to be done periodically, the said event shall be triggered at least *once per software cycle*.

## Safe State

In the *safe state* zero current is applied to the safety-critical outputs of the ECU, i.e. in case of an error all outputs will be switched off.

Safety-critical / Safety-relevant System The term *safety-critical* in the context of this document refers to a system whose failure or malfunction may result in death or injury. The HY-TTC 500 has been designed to fulfill ISO 13849 Category 2, Performance Level d and IEC 61508, Safety Integrity Level 2 requirements.

CAN data frame.

Stores a data frame for the CAN communication. <chunk_seperator> Il s'agit d'une part des capteurs HSI (HYDAC Sensor Interface) pour la pression, la température et le débit qui peuvent être raccordés à 8 canaux d'entrée analogiques. 

Par ailleurs, il est possible de raccorder des capteurs de Condition Monitoring HYDAC 
(capteurs CM) à ces entrées. Il s'agit de capteurs HSI HYDAC qui fournissent simultanément plusieurs grandeurs de mesure (valeur mesurées). 

Via la connexion du bus CAN, il est en outre possible de raccorder jusqu'à 28 capteurs HCSI (HYDAC CAN Sensor Interface) spéciaux, même avec une détection automatisée des capteurs. Les capteurs intelligents HYDAC peuvent aussi être lus, programmés et paramétrés. 

Une autre possibilité consiste à connecter l'HMG 4000 à un réseau CAN existant. Cette approche permet de collecter les données de mesure transmises sur le bus CAN (par ex. 

régime de moteur, pression de moteur) en association avec les données de mesure du système hydraulique. <chunk_seperator> Category: Requirement Label: Timer_Get ID: 592203 Related To: Related To':
For each safety-critical timer input stage, the application **shall** periodically trigger the measurement of pulse high-time, pulse low-time, period width, frequency or number of edges for pulsed sensor signals via the appropriate driver functions:
- *IO_PWD_ComplexGet()* - *IO_PWD_IncGet()* - *IO_PWD_CountGet()* 
- *IO_PWD_UniversalGet()* - *IO_PWD_GetCurrent()* Note 1: If a universal timer channel is co-configured for incremental mode together with any other combination of modes both the primary and secondary channel are redundantly configured. Thus, for safety-critical configuration, the application software needs to periodically trigger the measurement for both channels of complex or edge count modes. Note 2: If a complex timer channel is configured as safety-critical current timer input (parameter *pupd =* <chunk_seperator> IO_PWD_PD_90) the current measurement function *IO_PWD_GetCurrent()* needs to be called alongside one of the four remaining timer step functions. <chunk_seperator> ## - - 4.2 Input Stages - -

Category: Comment ID: 592155 The following section describes the requirements for utilization of input stages in safety-critical environments. Whenever a requirement demands the redundant usage of specific inputs, this redundancy does only correspond to the HY-TTC 500 input stage. The sensor, however, may feature a single channel architecture, as long as it is connected to both used inputs, in parallel. Still, the system integrator is responsible for calculating the overall dangerous failure rate of the complete channel involved in the execution of a safety function. The redundancy of input stages may also be established by combining different types of input stages—as long as both of the utilized input types support the desired mode of operation.

## 4.2.1 Timer Inputs <chunk_seperator> ## 4.2.1 Timer Inputs

Category: Comment ID: 592163 The digital timer inputs 0-5 (*IO_PWD_00* ... *IO_PWD_05*) provide the necessary diagnostic measures and are usable for safety-critical applications, when adhering to the requirements in the following section. The digital timer inputs 6-11 (*IO_PWD_06* ... *IO_PWD_11*) do not provide the same set of diagnostic measures and are therefore not usable for safety-critical applications without further restrictions. For details about their suitability, please refer to section *Guideline on Hardware Metrics Determination*. <chunk_seperator> ## Periodically

The term '*periodically*' or '*periodical*' within this documents refers for example to a frequently call of a function or a regular check of a state or variable. However, the 'periodically' condition is not related to certain time base, but to software cycles. Whenever something has to be done periodically, the said event shall be triggered at least *once per software cycle*.

## Safe State

In the *safe state* zero current is applied to the safety-critical outputs of the ECU, i.e. in case of an error all outputs will be switched off.

Safety-critical / Safety-relevant System The term *safety-critical* in the context of this document refers to a system whose failure or malfunction may result in death or injury. The HY-TTC 500 has been designed to fulfill ISO 13849 Category 2, Performance Level d and IEC 61508, Safety Integrity Level 2 requirements.

This requirement is also related to the power override K15, as mentioned in the requirement with ID 717653, which states that the application software shall not request a power-down of the ECU while the voltage level of terminal 15 (K15) is still high. This ensures that the device does not reset and power on again immediately, but rather performs a controlled shutdown when the voltage level of K15 is low.

The diagram shown in [image_id.png] illustrates the electrical circuit with various components, including a battery, transformer, inverter, and capacitors. The circuit is designed to ensure that the ECU's logic core remains functional even in the event of external short circuits on the actuator lines, and can store the occurrence of a shut-off condition to the failure memory before disabling the after-run mode and finally powering down completely."

As a result, the minimum and maximum duty cycles are limited, so that a test pulse for diagnostic measurements is present under all conditions which can be used for continuously testing the ability to deactivate the power stages.

The duty cycle limits and duty cycle tolerances are defined in the I/O driver. Depending on the initial I/O driver configuration, the HY-TTC 500 will either directly enter the safe state or leave the decision to the application software via the optional error callback (see section *Application Callbacks*). <chunk_seperator> ## 4.3.1 Pwm High Side Stages

Category: Comment ID: 592276 The PWM high side stages (*IO_PWM_00* ... *IO_PWM_35*) provide the necessary diagnostic measures and are usable for safety-critical applications, when adhering to the subsequent requirements. Every PWM high side stage also provides a dedicated current measurement function that can also be utilized for safety-critical functions, if required for a given system.

Category: Comment ID: 592272 Typically, the PWM high side stages of the HY-TTC 500 platform will be used for controlling valves. For a safe operation of these valves, the safety platform monitors the duty cycle and frequency of the PWM signals, at runtime. In addition, the outputs are checked for short circuits to ground or power supply as well as for open circuits (e.g. cable break). <chunk_seperator> Category: Requirement Label: Error_Callback_Timing ID: 590305 Related To: 626937 Related To':

Category: Comment ID: 592155 The following section describes the requirements for utilization of input stages in safety-critical environments. Whenever a requirement demands the redundant usage of specific inputs, this redundancy does only correspond to the HY-TTC 500 input stage. The sensor, however, may feature a single channel architecture, as long as it is connected to both used inputs, in parallel. Still, the system integrator is responsible for calculating the overall dangerous failure rate of the complete channel involved in the execution of a safety function. The redundancy of input stages may also be established by combining different types of input stages—as long as both of the utilized input types support the desired mode of operation.

## 4.2.1 Timer Inputs <chunk_seperator> Category: Requirement Label: PWM_Minimum_Energy ID: 592111 Related To: Related To':
The system integrator **shall** ensure that the PWM stage's lower duty cycle limit (i.e. the minimum possible duty cycle) does not already energize the connected actuator in a way that could lead to a dangerous situation.

Category: Comment ID: 919117 The minimum possible duty cycle results from the minimum pulse length (100 µs) that is present even if the application software deactivates a safety-critical high side stage. Depending on the configured PWM frequency, the minimum duty cycle might go up to a value of 10 %, i.e. for a PWM frequency of 1000 Hz.

## Functions

- IO_ErrorType IO_LIN_DeInit **(void)**
Deinitializes the LIN communication driver.

- IO_ErrorType IO_LIN_GetStatus **(void)**
Returns the status of the LIN channel.

- IO_ErrorType IO_LIN_Init (ubyte2 baudrate, ubyte1 **checksum_type)**
Initialization of the LIN communication driver.

- IO_ErrorType IO_LIN_Read (IO_LIN_DATA_FRAME ∗**const frame)**
Reads a LIN frame with the given id and of the given length. <chunk_seperator> In order to perform these diagnostics, the PWM signal's nature of having steadily changing voltage levels is used for comparing the desired signal sequence with the actual measurement. As a result, the minimum and maximum duty cycles are limited, so that a test pulse for diagnostic measurements is present under all conditions which can be used for continuously testing the ability to deactivate the power stages.

The duty cycle limits and duty cycle tolerances are defined in the I/O driver. Depending on the initial I/O driver configuration, the HY-TTC 500 will either directly enter the safe state or leave the decision to the application software via the optional error callback (see section *Application Callbacks*). <chunk_seperator> ## 4.3.1 Pwm High Side Stages

Category: Comment ID: 592276 The PWM high side stages (*IO_PWM_00* ... *IO_PWM_35*) provide the necessary diagnostic measures and are usable for safety-critical applications, when adhering to the subsequent requirements. Every PWM high side stage also provides a dedicated current measurement function that can also be utilized for safety-critical functions, if required for a given system.

Category: Comment ID: 592272 Typically, the PWM high side stages of the HY-TTC 500 platform will be used for controlling valves. For a safe operation of these valves, the safety platform monitors the duty cycle and frequency of the PWM signals, at runtime. In addition, the outputs are checked for short circuits to ground or power supply as well as for open circuits (e.g. cable break). <chunk_seperator> Category: Requirement Label: Error_Callback_Timing ID: 590305 Related To: 626937 Related To':

An acceptable upper limit for the execution of the callback function is 1 ms. This assures that the device's failure reaction time is not increased by the implementation of the callback function.

Category: Comment ID: 590311 The notification callback has no such limitation as the safe state is activated before this callback is called. It is still recommended to keep the notification callback function short because most interrupts

Category: Comment ID: 592155 The following section describes the requirements for utilization of input stages in safety-critical environments. Whenever a requirement demands the redundant usage of specific inputs, this redundancy does only correspond to the HY-TTC 500 input stage. The sensor, however, may feature a single channel architecture, as long as it is connected to both used inputs, in parallel. Still, the system integrator is responsible for calculating the overall dangerous failure rate of the complete channel involved in the execution of a safety function. The redundancy of input stages may also be established by combining different types of input stages—as long as both of the utilized input types support the desired mode of operation.

## 4.2.1 Timer Inputs <chunk_seperator> Category: Requirement Label: PWM_Minimum_Energy ID: 592111 Related To: Related To':
The system integrator **shall** ensure that the PWM stage's lower duty cycle limit (i.e. the minimum possible duty cycle) does not already energize the connected actuator in a way that could lead to a dangerous situation.

Category: Comment ID: 919117 The minimum possible duty cycle results from the minimum pulse length (100 µs) that is present even if the application software deactivates a safety-critical high side stage. Depending on the configured PWM frequency, the minimum duty cycle might go up to a value of 10 %, i.e. for a PWM frequency of 1000 Hz.

Category: Comment ID: 591251 The measurement values required for diagnostics will be checked internally by the diagnostic module of the I/O driver. The system integrator has to take care of correctly setting up the safety-critical outputs during initialization and periodically calling the output's step functions (e.g. *IO_DO_Set()*) with a cycle time that is appropriate for the diagnostic purpose of the overall system. <chunk_seperator> ## 9.1 Analog Sensors

Category: Comment ID: 592087 For being capable of providing analog inputs for safety-critical applications, the HY-TTC 500 platform requires diagnostic measures to be present within the analog input path. Depending on the analog input type, the system integrator may have to comply with specific requirements in order to allow safety-critical utilization, as specified in the before-mentioned section *Analog Inputs*.

The following section will describe typical analog sensor types together with their detailed characteristics.

## 7.8.1 Detailed Description

IO Driver functions for handling Ethernet download requests.

Because an Ethernet link establishment can take up to 3 seconds, any Ethernet download request from the TTC-Downloader cannot be checked during power up (as it is the case for CAN). To make it possible anyway, the DOWNLOAD module can be used for. It's being initialized with **IO_DOWNLOAD_**
Init(). The DOWLNLOAD module automatically checks for TTC-Downloader requests on the Ethernet interface. This request consists of a handshake between the **TTC-Downloader and the ECU. To**
check, if any request is pending, IO_DOWNLOAD_CheckRequest() **can be used.**
After a detected request, the application has a time of 3 seconds to launch the download mode.

Within this time, the application needs to shut down and all non-volatile memories need to be stored. <chunk_seperator> Category: Comment ID: 609549 For ultimately entering the safe state (i.e. in case the application software detects a fatal error, e.g. a redundancy mismatch), the HY-TTC 500 I/O driver library provides the function DIAG_EnterSafestate() that allows an application driven safe state. Whenever a requirement demands the application software to enter the safe state, this function has to be utilized for the corresponding state transition.

## 7.8.1 Detailed Description

IO Driver functions for handling Ethernet download requests.

Because an Ethernet link establishment can take up to 3 seconds, any Ethernet download request from the TTC-Downloader cannot be checked during power up (as it is the case for CAN). To make it possible anyway, the DOWNLOAD module can be used for. It's being initialized with **IO_DOWNLOAD_**
Init(). The DOWLNLOAD module automatically checks for TTC-Downloader requests on the Ethernet interface. This request consists of a handshake between the **TTC-Downloader and the ECU. To**
check, if any request is pending, IO_DOWNLOAD_CheckRequest() **can be used.**
After a detected request, the application has a time of 3 seconds to launch the download mode.

Within this time, the application needs to shut down and all non-volatile memories need to be stored. <chunk_seperator> Category: Comment ID: 609549 For ultimately entering the safe state (i.e. in case the application software detects a fatal error, e.g. a redundancy mismatch), the HY-TTC 500 I/O driver library provides the function DIAG_EnterSafestate() that allows an application driven safe state. Whenever a requirement demands the application software to enter the safe state, this function has to be utilized for the corresponding state transition.

## 7.8.1 Detailed Description

IO Driver functions for handling Ethernet download requests.

Because an Ethernet link establishment can take up to 3 seconds, any Ethernet download request from the TTC-Downloader cannot be checked during power up (as it is the case for CAN). To make it possible anyway, the DOWNLOAD module can be used for. It's being initialized with **IO_DOWNLOAD_**
Init(). The DOWLNLOAD module automatically checks for TTC-Downloader requests on the Ethernet interface. This request consists of a handshake between the **TTC-Downloader and the ECU. To**
check, if any request is pending, IO_DOWNLOAD_CheckRequest() **can be used.**
After a detected request, the application has a time of 3 seconds to launch the download mode.

Within this time, the application needs to shut down and all non-volatile memories need to be stored. <chunk_seperator> Category: Comment ID: 609549 For ultimately entering the safe state (i.e. in case the application software detects a fatal error, e.g. a redundancy mismatch), the HY-TTC 500 I/O driver library provides the function DIAG_EnterSafestate() that allows an application driven safe state. Whenever a requirement demands the application software to enter the safe state, this function has to be utilized for the corresponding state transition.

## 5.1 Initialization - - - - - -

Category: Requirement Label: Driver_Init ID: 609559 Related To: 460039 Related To':
The application software **shall** call the general initialization function *IO_Driver_Init()* before calling any other driver function. <chunk_seperator> Category: Comment ID: 609543 The interface between the application and the HY-TTC 500 platform is defined by the C-driver API. For a detailed description please refer to the HY-TTC 500 I/O Driver User Manual [TTC500-IOUM]. In case the application software is not written in C (but e.g. generated with Matlab/Simulink), the system integrator has to ensure that the generated object or C-code is correct by performing appropriate tests for fulfilling the respective safety performance.
