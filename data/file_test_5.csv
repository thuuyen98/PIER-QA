IO Driver functions for CAN communication.

The CAN driver uses the DCAN module of the TMS570 CPU.

The CAN driver supports up to 7 CAN channels. The number of available channels depends on the used HW variant.

All CAN nodes have an own set of message objects and can not be allocated to other CAN nodes. For further details on message objects see **CAN handles and message objects.** CAN-API Usage:
- **Examples for CAN API functions**

## 7.5.2 Usage Of The Acceptance Masks

The acceptance mask defines the relevant bits of the CAN ID. A binary 1 marks a relevant bit in the CAN ID on the same position.

Setting all bits of the acceptance mask (0x1FFFFFFF) only accepts the ID set with the ID parameter and rejects all other IDs. Setting the acceptance mask to 0 causes the message buffer to accept any IDs. <chunk_seperator> {'5.4': 'Add button'}, {'5.5': 'Add Repository dialog'}, {'5.6': 'TI Compiler Updates branch'}, {'5.7': 'ARM Compiler Tools 5.1.6'}, {'5.8': 'Contents of the Get_Started directory'}, {'5.9': 'The examples and template directories'}, {'5.10': 'Settings.mk'}, {'5.11': 'Select new wizard page'}, {'5.12': 'Import Existing Code page'}, {'5.13': 'Browse For Folder dialog'}, {'5.14': 'Console pane with successful build'}, {'5.15': 'Includes'}, {'5.16': 'Application Descriptor Block (APDB)'}, {'5.17': 'Application initialization'}, {'5.18': 'Application loop'}, {'5.19': 'Linking constant data to the external flash and/or application configuration data', '.': '31'}, {'5.20': 'Lauterbach Base Station'}, {'5.21': 'Trace32 Software'}, {'5.22': 'Chosse Destination Location page'}, {'5.23': 'Installation Type page'}, {'5.24': 'Setup Type page'}, {'5.25': 'TRACE32 Product Type page'}, {'5.26': 'Maintenance Notice page'}, {'5.27': 'Debugger Interface Type page'}, {'5.28': 'OS Selection page'}, <chunk_seperator> Trace32 windows dialog'}, {'5.47': 'Trace32 Window after flashing'}, {'5.48': 'TTC-Downloader'}, {'6.1': 'Memory map for HY-TTC 500 internal Flash'}, {'6.2': 'Memory map for HY-TTC 500 external RAM and Flash'}]</table_3> <chunk_seperator> 'yes': 'no'}, {'DECODE_B1': 'error'}, {'46': 'DIAG_E_INIT_CORE_DCC1_', 'yes': 'no'}, {'47': 'DIAG_E_INIT_CORE_DCC2_', 'yes': 'no'}, {'48': 'DIAG_E_INIT_CORE_ERROR_', 'yes': 'no'}, {'49': 'DIAG_E_INIT_CORE_MPU_', 'yes': 'no'}, {'50': 'DIAG_E_INIT_CORE_RAM_', 'yes': 'no'}, {'51': 'DIAG_E_INIT_CORE_RAM_', 'yes': 'no'}, {'52': 'DIAG_E_CORE_READBACK', 'yes': 'no'}, {'53': 'DIAG_E_APPL_SAFE_STATE', 'yes': 'no'}, {'54': 'DIAG_E_DRIVER_INIT', 'yes': 'no'}, {'55': 'DIAG_E_DATA_ABORT', 'yes': 'no'}, {'56': 'DIAG_E_PREFETCH_ABORT', 'yes': 'no'}, {'57': 'DIAG_E_UNDEF_INSTRUCTION', 'yes': 'no'}, {'58': 'DIAG_E_ESM_HLI', 'yes': 'no'}, {'59': 'DIAG_E_ESM_LLI', 'yes': 'no'}, {'60': 'DIAG_E_ESM_LLI_CALLBACK', 'no': 'no'}]</table_15> <chunk_seperator> <table_2>[{'3.1': 'HY-TTC 500 Starter Kit'}, {'-------': '-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------', '-----': '-----'}, {'3.2': 'HY-TTC 500 Starter Kit for C programming'}, {'4.1': 'HY-TTC 500 Interface Board'}, {'4.2': 'HY-TTC 500 Interface Board CAN Termination'}, {'4.3': 'HY-TTC 500 Interface Board CAN Termination'}, {'4.4': 'HY-TTC 500 Interface Board Power Supply'}, {'4.5': 'HY-TTC 500 Interface Board Power Supply'}, {'4.6': 'HY-TTC 500 Interface Board Terminal 15 (KL15)'}, {'4.7': 'HY-TTC 500 Interface Board Terminal 15 (KL15)'}, {'4.8': 'Status LEDs'}, {'4.9': 'Status LEDs'}, {'4.10': 'Jumpers for Ethernet or BroadR-Reach®mode'}, {'5.1': 'CCS Edit - Code Composer Studio'}, {'5.2': 'Show only. . . check box'}, {'5.3': 'Work with field'}, {'5.4': 'Add button'}, {'5.5': 'Add Repository dialog'}, {'5.6': 'TI Compiler Updates branch'}, {'5.7': 'ARM Compiler Tools 5.1.6'}, {'5.8': 'Contents of the Get_Started directory'}, {'5.9': 'The <chunk_seperator> ![121_image_1.png]( The image displays a computer screen with a text box open on it.

## 5.4.1.4 Recording Settings

In the recording settings the recording interval can be adjusted. This setting defines the interval of the recorded values that are to be stored. The interval is adjustable in stages from 10 seconds to 2 hours by the user. Stored values are: the absolute conductivity, the absolute DC, the current temperature, min/max temperature values and the saturation level. The log has a data storage with 3 storage levels. If the storage space is exhausted, a number of data sets will be compressed to one data set, marked with a time stamp and then moved to the next level. The values can be stored for up to 10 years.

Constant data is linked to the application region by default. However, it can also be linked to the external flash memory (if available) or to the application configuration data region. The major difference is the integrity protection of their respective contents. While constant data linked to the external flash memory is protected by the application CRC, the application configuration data region's integrity must be ensured by the application itself. Figure 5.19 on the facing page depicts an example of how to link constant data to the external flash memory as well as to the application configuration data region.

Category: Comment ID: 959339 The HY-TTC 500 platform's timer inputs 06-11 (*IO_PWD_06 ... IO_PWD_11*) allow to directly measure the signals of dedicated frequency sensors with different output characteristics (e.g. PNP-type, NPNtype, current loop). However, due to their internal structure, these timer inputs **must not** be utilized safety-critically on their own in measurement modes timer input, encoder input or digital input.

## Figure 5.19: Linking Constant Data To The External Flash And/Or Application Configuration Data 5.7.5 Safety Configuration

For safety-critical applications, every safety-critical IO pin can be initialized with a safety configuration. Please refer to **HY-TTC_500_Series_C_API_Manual.chm** [4] for further details.

To enable any outputs, the I/O Driver has to be configured with a valid safety configuration. The I/O Driver safety configuration consists of several elements:
- **command_period [**µs]: Sets the period at which the application cycle is executed.

Important: The **command_period** is checked by the watchdog and has to meet the window configuration.

- **window_size [%]**: Configures the size of the window for the watchdog which checks the command_period. The application cycle has to fulfill those timing requirements.
Question:  What is the duration of each cycle in the given case?","The duration of each cycle in the given case is 10000 µs. This information is provided in the context, and it is also related to the parameter **safety_conf.command_period** mentioned in the section about safety configuration."

Question:  What is the difference in integrity protection between constant data linked to external flash memory and the application configuration data region?","The difference in integrity protection between constant data linked to external flash memory and the application configuration data region lies in the way their contents are protected.

Constant data linked to the external flash memory is protected by the application CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check). This means that any modification to the data will lead to an invalid application CRC, ensuring the integrity of the data.

On the other hand, the application configuration data region's integrity must be ensured by the application itself. This means that the application is responsible for protecting the data in this region, and there is no built-in protection mechanism like the application CRC.

In summary, constant data linked to external flash memory has built-in protection through the application CRC, whereas the application configuration data region relies on the application itself to ensure data integrity."

- **window_size [%]**: Configures the size of the window for the watchdog which checks the command_period. The application cycle has to fulfill those timing requirements.
Question:  What is the purpose of the **command_period** in the I/O Driver safety configuration?","The purpose of the **command_period** in the I/O Driver safety configuration is to set the period at which the application cycle is executed. In this specific case, the duration of each cycle is 10000 µs. This **command_period** is also checked by the watchdog and has to meet the window configuration, which is defined by the **window_size** parameter. This ensures that the application cycle fulfills the required timing requirements, which is crucial for safety-critical applications."

Constant data is linked to the application region by default. However, it can also be linked to the external flash memory (if available) or to the application configuration data region. The major difference is the integrity protection of their respective contents. While constant data linked to the external flash memory is protected by the application CRC, the application configuration data region's integrity must be ensured by the application itself. Figure 5.19 on the facing page depicts an example of how to link constant data to the external flash memory as well as to the application configuration data region.

## Figure 5.19: Linking Constant Data To The External Flash And/Or Application Configuration Data 5.7.5 Safety Configuration

For safety-critical applications, every safety-critical IO pin can be initialized with a safety configuration. Please refer to **HY-TTC_500_Series_C_API_Manual.chm** [4] for further details.

To enable any outputs, the I/O Driver has to be configured with a valid safety configuration. The I/O Driver safety configuration consists of several elements:
- **command_period [**µs]: Sets the period at which the application cycle is executed.

Important: The **command_period** is checked by the watchdog and has to meet the window configuration.

- **window_size [%]**: Configures the size of the window for the watchdog which checks the command_period. The application cycle has to fulfill those timing requirements.
Question:  What checks the **command_period** to ensure it meets the timing requirements?",The watchdog checks the **command_period** to ensure it meets the timing requirements.

Question:  What is the significance of the clock visible on the initial computer screen, and how does it relate to the software program being used?","The clock visible on the initial computer screen, as shown in [38_image_0.png], holds significant importance in the context of the software program being used. The presence of two clocks, one located near the top left corner and another towards the bottom right side, suggests that the user might be monitoring time-sensitive tasks or events related to the software program.

This implies that the software program is likely being used for tasks that require precise timing, synchronization, or scheduling. The clocks may be used to track the elapsed time for specific tasks , monitor deadlines , or schedule events within the program . This could be particularly important in applications such as trading , finance , or debugging , where timely execution is crucial .

Furthermore , the clocks may also serve as a visual reminder for the user to stay focused on the tasks at hand , ensuring that they are completed within the allotted timeframe . In a broader sense , the clocks may symbolize the importance of time management in the software program , emphasizing the need for efficient and effective task execution .

In the context of the provided images , the software program appears to be related to trading or finance , as evident from [38_image_1.png] , which displays an advertisement for a software product called TRADE . This further supports the notion that the clocks are used to monitor time-sensitive tasks or events related to The software program .

Question:  What is the purpose of the Lauterbach Base Station and its associated components?","The Lauterbach Base Station and its associated components, including the Power Debug Interface USB 3 LA-3500, Lauterbach Debug Cable JTAG-CORTEX-A/R LA-7843, Lauterbach AC/DC power supply adapter, and USB connector, are designed to facilitate the connection and debugging of electronic devices, particularly those using the JTAG interface.

The primary purpose of the Lauterbach Base Station is to provide a platform for debugging and testing electronic devices, such as the HY-TTC 580 Starter Kit, which is a complex electronic system. The Base Station enables developers and engineers to connect their devices to a computer, allowing them to monitor, debug, and test the device's functionality, performance, and behavior.

The associated components, such as the Power Debug Interface and Debug Cable, are used to establish a connection between the device under test and the Base Station, enabling the transfer of data, power, and control signals. The AC/DC power supply adapter is used to provide a stable power source to the device, while the USB connector facilitates the connection to a computer.

In summary, the Lauterbach Base Station and its components are essential tools for the development, testing, and debugging of complex electronic devices, enabling developers to identify and fix issues, optimize performance, and ensure the reliability of their products."

Question:  What is the purpose of the Debug LEDs in the electronic component?","The Debug LEDs in the electronic component are used for debugging purposes. They provide visual indicators of the component's status, allowing developers to quickly identify issues or problems. In this specific case, the Debug LEDs are controlled by the `IO_DEBUG_SetOutputPin()` function, which suggests that they are used to monitor and control the output pins of the component.

The presence of the Debug LEDs and their controllability by the application imply that the component is designed for testing and debugging purposes. This is likely a development board or a prototype, rather than a final product.

The image of the electronic component also shows various connectors, screws, and other components, which further supports the idea that this is a development board or a prototype. The close-up view of the component allows for detailed examination of its internal structure and components.

Overall, the Debug LEDs are an essential tool for developers to test, debug, and refine their designs, ensuring that the final product meets the required specifications and functions as intended."

Question:  What are the two scenarios for connecting to the device via Ethernet, and what do you need to do in each scenario to proceed with the flashing process?","There are two scenarios for connecting to the device via Ethernet:

Scenario 1: The target has no application and no CODESYS runtime system flashed.

In this scenario, you need to use the default connection settings. To set the default settings, open the **Preferences** dialog box (e.g., with Ctrl + P) and click **Default**.

Scenario 2: The target has an application or CODESYS runtime system flashed.

In this scenario, you need to enter the correct Ethernet settings. If you do not know the correct Ethernet settings, it is recommended to use CAN to connect with the target as described in Section 5.8.2.2.1. To set the correct Ethernet settings, open the **Preferences** dialog box (e.g., with Ctrl + P), enter the values, and click **Apply**.

In both scenarios, after setting the correct connection settings, you can proceed with the flashing process by opening the TTC-Downloader and connecting to the device via Ethernet."

OUT OF THE APPLICATION OR USE OF THESE PRODUCTS OR SAMPLES. THE EXCLUSION
OF LIABILITY DOES NOT APPLY IN CASES OF INTENT AND GROSS NEGLIGENCE. MOREOVER, IT DOES NOT APPLY TO DEFECTS WHICH HAVE BEEN DECEITFULLY CONCEALED

CLAIMS DUE TO STATUTORY PROVISIONS OF PRODUCT LIABILTY SHALL REMAIN UNAFFECTED. <chunk_seperator> ## Legal Disclaimer <chunk_seperator> In PVG mode, PVG valves have a well-defined input resistance, **and the output signal settings can** be calculated in advance by considering the characteristics of the output stage. In voltage mode, however, a PID controller must be applied to generate the desired output voltage. This results in a certain settling time, which depends on the parameter set of **the PID controllers.**
The VOUT **mode output can be used to control PVG valves of the type PVEU or other generic resistive**
loads.

For diagnostic reasons, the output signal is looped back to the CPU in output mode, and the measured value is compared to the set value. If the difference between these two values is above a fixed limit, an overload is detected and the output is disabled. The protection mechanism tries to reenable the output 10 times per drive cycle. It is not allowed to use two outputs in parallel to increase driving strength.
