 Question:  What is the structure principle of a CAN data message, as described in section 4.3.1?","The structure principle of a CAN (Controller Area Network) data message, as described in section 4.3.1 of the Virtual Fluid Lab (VFL) documentation, is a fundamental concept in understanding the data communication protocol used in the VFL system.

A CAN data message, also known as a CAN frame, consists of seven bytes of data, which are transmitted serially over the CAN bus. The structure of a CAN data message can be broken down into several components:

1. **Start of Frame (SOF)**: A single bit that marks the beginning of a new CAN frame.
2. **Identifier (ID)**: An 11-bit or 29-bit identifier that uniquely identifies the message and determines its priority on the bus. The ID is divided into two parts: the Node ID and the Message ID.
3. **Remote Transmission Request (RTR)**: A single bit that indicates whether the message is a data frame or a remote request frame.
4. **Data Field**: A 0- to 8-byte data field that carries the actual data being transmitted.
5. **CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)**: A 15-bit or 17-bit error-checking code that ensures the integrity of the transmitted data.
6. **ACK (Acknowledgment)**: A 2-bit acknowledgment field that indicates whether the message was received correctly by the destination node.
7. **End of Frame (EOF)**: A 7-bit field that marks the end of the CAN frame.

The structure principle of a CAN data message is designed to ensure reliable, efficient, and flexible data communication between devices on the CAN bus. By understanding this structure, developers and users of the VFL system can effectively utilize the CANopen protocol to exchange data between devices and achieve their desired application goals.

In the context of the VFL system, this knowledge is essential for configuring and using the product within a superordinate control system, as described in the preface of the documentation."

 Question:  What should be done before each startup, installation, or replacement of the measurement system, and why is it important?","Before each startup, installation, or replacement of the measurement system, it is crucial to undergo a visual check for damage. This is explicitly stated in the documentation, the ""Quick Start General Information"" section. This precautionary measure is vital to ensure the safe and proper functioning of the measurement system.

The importance of this visual inspection lies in the potential risks associated with damaged equipment. If the instrument is not handled correctly or if the operating instructions and specifications are not adhered to, damage to property and/or personal injury can result. This warning is emphasized by the cautionary sign [6_image_0.png] which indicates potential hazards or dangers.

By performing a visual check, users can identify any potential issues or damage to the measurement system or its related accessories. This proactive approach helps prevent accidents, ensures the system operates within specified parameters, and maintains the overall safety of the application.

In essence, the visual inspection is a critical step in the startup, installation, or replacement process, as it directly impacts the safe and reliable operation of the measurement system."

 Question:  What is the purpose of the Object Dictionary (OD) in the context of CANopen communication protocol?","The purpose of the Object Dictionary (OD) in the context of the CANopen communication protocol is to provide a comprehensive and electronically readable description of all communication objects offered by the product. In other words, the Object Dictionary serves as a repository of information that defines the structure and organization of the data exchanged between devices or nodes in a CANopen-based network.

The OD plays a crucial role in ensuring seamless communication among devices, as it enables them to understand the meaning and format of the data being transmitted. This is particularly important in the context of industrial automation, where devices from different manufacturers need to interact with each other.

By providing a standardized description of the communication objects, the Object Dictionary facilitates the integration of devices from various manufacturers, thereby promoting interoperability and reducing the complexity of system integration. This, in turn, enables users to focus on developing their applications, rather than worrying about the intricacies of device communication.

In essence, the Object Dictionary is a fundamental component of the CANopen protocol, as it enables devices to communicate effectively and efficiently, thereby ensuring the reliable exchange of data in industrial automation systems."

The figures without additional markings are displayed as numeric figures with decimals 
(number basis 10). For a more simple display of data blocks, however, hexadecimal representation is also very commonly used (number basis 16). In our document, the hexadecimals are generally marked by an ""h"" as a suffix. 

Decimal numbers, when displayed in a mixed representation, are marked with the additional suffix ""d"". Binary numbers (number basis 2) are marked by suffix ""b"". 

## Note

 12h **12 hexadecimal → 18 decimal** 

 A2h **A2 hexadecimal → 162 decimal** 

 16d **16 decimal → 10 hexadecimal** 66 **66 decimal → 42 hexadecimal** 

 10b **10 binary → 2 decimal** <chunk_seperator> The following sections will explain general, non-product specific information for a better understanding of the functioning principle of a measurement system with a communication interface. 

## 2.1. General Communication Characteristics

In general, the measurement systems are the end-nodes within a communication network. They do not take control of their superordinate network themselves. However, these devices are able to generate and send information spontaneously. This means that the measurement systems mainly serve as a data source - they generate process data. 

The following types of information can be generated and processed by the measurement system: 
 *Process data* **current actual or nominal values**
 *Parameters* **System data for the device identification or configuration**
 *Events* **Information on particular events, such as errors** 
The information types listed here are explained in more detail in the following chapters.

HYDAC Filtertechnik GmbH continuously strives to respect human rights and every individual's dignity in any context. However, when it comes to communication technology, one technical term is still very common: ""Master - Slave"". In order to avoid this archaic and discriminating expression, the term has been replaced wherever possible in this documentation, using the following substitution: ""Master - Device"" (""Device"" replacing ""Slave""). The only exceptions are terms which are used in this form in official documentation. These exceptions are only used to make it easier for the reader to understand the connection between this documentation and the official documents. 

## 2. Fundamentals And Basics

The following sections will explain general, non-product specific information for a better understanding of the functioning principle of a measurement system with a communication interface. <chunk_seperator> ## 1.5.1. Chapter Structure

The general structure is divided into the following essential chapters. 

## 2 Fundamentals **And Basics**

General information explaining the function principle of a measuring system equipped with a communication interface. 

## 3 Product **Interface**

All the product specific characteristics are described here. Certain sections of this description may repeat and differ at the same time in the protocol description if the measurement system described herein deviates from the general protocol description or if the properties of the protocol description are complemented.

## 4 Protocol Description **Canopen**

The general protocol description provides you with all information required for a successful communication. It explains, for instance, how the process data is transmitted with this specific communication protocol. In addition, it explains how to change the measurement system configuration settings. <chunk_seperator> ## Note

 12h **12 hexadecimal → 18 decimal** 

 A2h **A2 hexadecimal → 162 decimal** 

 16d **16 decimal → 10 hexadecimal** 66 **66 decimal → 42 hexadecimal** 

 10b **10 binary → 2 decimal** 

In other documentations, i.e. EDS files, you will also frequently encounter the format 
""0**x1042"". Here, the prefix ""0x"" marks the subsequent number as a hexadecimal.** When describing the entries in the OD (see chapter *4.5 The Object* Dictionary). **The index** 
is always shown in hexadecimal notation, but without any particular markings. 

## 2.3. Bit Order

The measurement systems use the ""Little Endian"" format for the transmission of their numeric values. In this representation of numeric values, the lowest bit (LSB; ""least significant bit"") will be stored and added the lowest data block address.

The figures without additional markings are displayed as numeric figures with decimals 
(number basis 10). For a more simple display of data blocks, however, hexadecimal representation is also very commonly used (number basis 16). In our document, the hexadecimals are generally marked by an ""h"" as a suffix. 

Decimal numbers, when displayed in a mixed representation, are marked with the additional suffix ""d"". Binary numbers (number basis 2) are marked by suffix ""b"". 

## Note

 12h **12 hexadecimal → 18 decimal** 

 A2h **A2 hexadecimal → 162 decimal** 

 16d **16 decimal → 10 hexadecimal** 66 **66 decimal → 42 hexadecimal** 

 10b **10 binary → 2 decimal** <chunk_seperator> The following sections will explain general, non-product specific information for a better understanding of the functioning principle of a measurement system with a communication interface. 

## 2.1. General Communication Characteristics

In general, the measurement systems are the end-nodes within a communication network. They do not take control of their superordinate network themselves. However, these devices are able to generate and send information spontaneously. This means that the measurement systems mainly serve as a data source - they generate process data. 

The following types of information can be generated and processed by the measurement system: 
 *Process data* **current actual or nominal values**
 *Parameters* **System data for the device identification or configuration**
 *Events* **Information on particular events, such as errors** 
The information types listed here are explained in more detail in the following chapters.

HYDAC Filtertechnik GmbH continuously strives to respect human rights and every individual's dignity in any context. However, when it comes to communication technology, one technical term is still very common: ""Master - Slave"". In order to avoid this archaic and discriminating expression, the term has been replaced wherever possible in this documentation, using the following substitution: ""Master - Device"" (""Device"" replacing ""Slave""). The only exceptions are terms which are used in this form in official documentation. These exceptions are only used to make it easier for the reader to understand the connection between this documentation and the official documents. 

## 2. Fundamentals And Basics

The following sections will explain general, non-product specific information for a better understanding of the functioning principle of a measurement system with a communication interface. <chunk_seperator> ## 1.5.1. Chapter Structure

The general structure is divided into the following essential chapters. 

## 2 Fundamentals **And Basics**

General information explaining the function principle of a measuring system equipped with a communication interface. 

## 3 Product **Interface**

All the product specific characteristics are described here. Certain sections of this description may repeat and differ at the same time in the protocol description if the measurement system described herein deviates from the general protocol description or if the properties of the protocol description are complemented.

## 4 Protocol Description **Canopen**

The general protocol description provides you with all information required for a successful communication. It explains, for instance, how the process data is transmitted with this specific communication protocol. In addition, it explains how to change the measurement system configuration settings. <chunk_seperator> ## Note

 A2h **A2 hexadecimal → 162 decimal** 

 16d **16 decimal → 10 hexadecimal** 66 **66 decimal → 42 hexadecimal** 

 10b **10 binary → 2 decimal** 

In other documentations, i.e. EDS files, you will also frequently encounter the format 
""0**x1042"". Here, the prefix ""0x"" marks the subsequent number as a hexadecimal.** When describing the entries in the OD (see chapter *4.5 The Object* Dictionary). **The index** 
is always shown in hexadecimal notation, but without any particular markings. 

## 2.3. Bit Order

The measurement systems use the ""Little Endian"" format for the transmission of their numeric values. In this representation of numeric values, the lowest bit (LSB; ""least significant bit"") will be stored and added the lowest data block address.

However, these devices are able to generate and send information spontaneously. This means that the measurement systems mainly serve as a data source - they generate process data. 

The following types of information can be generated and processed by the measurement system: 
 *Process data* **current actual or nominal values**
 *Parameters* **System data for the device identification or configuration**
 *Events* **Information on particular events, such as errors** 
The information types listed here are explained in more detail in the following chapters.

HYDAC Filtertechnik GmbH continuously strives to respect human rights and every individual's dignity in any context. However, when it comes to communication technology, one technical term is still very common: ""Master - Slave"". In order to avoid this archaic and discriminating expression, the term has been replaced wherever possible in this documentation, using the following substitution: ""Master - Device"" (""Device"" replacing ""Slave""). The only exceptions are terms which are used in this form in official documentation. These exceptions are only used to make it easier for the reader to understand the connection between this documentation and the official documents. 

## 2. Fundamentals And Basics

The following sections will explain general, non-product specific information for a better understanding of the functioning principle of a measurement system with a communication interface. <chunk_seperator> ## 1.5.1. Chapter Structure

The general structure is divided into the following essential chapters. 

## 2 Fundamentals **And Basics**

General information explaining the function principle of a measuring system equipped with a communication interface. 

## 3 Product **Interface**

All the product specific characteristics are described here. Certain sections of this description may repeat and differ at the same time in the protocol description if the measurement system described herein deviates from the general protocol description or if the properties of the protocol description are complemented.

## 4 Protocol Description **Canopen**

The general protocol description provides you with all information required for a successful communication. It explains, for instance, how the process data is transmitted with this specific communication protocol. In addition, it explains how to change the measurement system configuration settings. <chunk_seperator> ## Note

 A2h **A2 hexadecimal → 162 decimal** 

 16d **16 decimal → 10 hexadecimal** 66 **66 decimal → 42 hexadecimal** 

 10b **10 binary → 2 decimal** 

In other documentations, i.e. EDS files, you will also frequently encounter the format 
""0**x1042"". Here, the prefix ""0x"" marks the subsequent number as a hexadecimal.** When describing the entries in the OD (see chapter *4.5 The Object* Dictionary). **The index** 
is always shown in hexadecimal notation, but without any particular markings. 

## 2.3. Bit Order

The measurement systems use the ""Little Endian"" format for the transmission of their numeric values. In this representation of numeric values, the lowest bit (LSB; ""least significant bit"") will be stored and added the lowest data block address.

## System Cpu <chunk_seperator> For all data types, the display of numeric values described in the chapter *2.3 Bit* **order** is applicable to the storage within data blocks. 

## 2.4.1. Integer

INTEGER is the term for signed whole numbers whose data length may vary. Negative figures will be specified by a two's complement [NOT(<numeric value>)1]. The data length is specified in bits and is added as a suffix right after the data type identifier. If the most significant bit is an INTEGER figure 1, this will be negative. 

<table_11>[{'Data type': 'Length [Bit]', 'Min.': 'Max.'}, {'-------------': '------------'}, {'INTEGER8': '8', '-128': '+127'}, {'INTEGER16': '16', '-32.768': '+32.767'}, {'INTEGER32': '32', '-2147483648': '2147483647'}]</table_11>
Therefore, INTEGER16 means it is a signed whole number whose data length is 16 bits. For the illustration of data in a data block of more than 1 byte of length, the bit order has to be paid attention to; see chapter 2.3 Bit **order.** 

## 2.4.2. Unsigned <chunk_seperator> ## 2.4.2. Unsigned

UNSIGNED specifies unsigned whole numbers. This means that only positive figures can be displayed using this data type. The data length in bytes is added as a suffix. UNSIGNED32 is a whole numeric value without a sign and with a data length of 32 bits. 

<table_12>[{'Data type': 'Length [Bit]', 'Min.': 'Max.'}, {'-------------': '----------------', '--------': '------------'}, {'UNSIGNED8': '8', '0': '+255'}, {'UNSIGNED16': '16', '0': '+65.535'}, {'UNSIGNED32': '32', '0': '4294967295'}]</table_12>
For the illustration of data in a data block of more than 1 byte of length, the bit order has to be paid attention to; see chapter 2.3 Bit **order.** 

## 2.4.3. Boolean

The data type BOOLEAN is used to illustrate binary signals. These are signals which are not able to adopt more than two logical states. The data length in the memory may vary. If an individual binary signal is stored in the memory, the data type is usually an *UNSIGNED8*. <chunk_seperator> -

If the application software's error callback is executed due to a failing safety switch startup test (i.e. error code *DIAG_E_SSW_TEST*), the application software **shall** define an action to be taken according to the overall system design.

Category: Comment ID: 808085 In case of a failing safety switch startup test that cannot be traced back to an isolated failure of an associated PWM high side stage, the complete safety switch group might be impaired. The system integrator is therefore advised to immediately disable the affected safety switch and all connected PWM high side stages.

A defective safety switch—acting as secondary shut-off path of a safety-related PWM high side stage—is considered dangerous and does therefore not allow further operation of the affected PWM high side stages. <chunk_seperator> <table_98>[{'Symbol': 'Parameter', 'Note': 'Min.', 'Max.': 'Unit'}, {'--------------------------------------------------': '-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------', '-----------------': '--------', '----------': '---------', '------': '----'}, {'BAT+max Permanent non-destructive supply voltage': '1', '-32': '32'}, {'BAT+lim': 'Peak', 'non-destructive': 'supply', 'clamping': 'voltage', '1, 2': '-40', '45': 'V'}, {'I in-lim': 'Peak', 'non-destructive': 'supply', 'clamping': 'current', '1, 2': '-10', '+100': 'A'}, {'Td': 'Load dump protection time according to ISO 7637- 2 [20], Pulse 5, Level IV (superimposed 174 V, Ri = 2 Ω)', '1': '350'}, {'I in-max': 'Permanent battery supply current (all 6 pins in parallel with symmetrical wire connection))', '3': '60'}, {'I in-max': 'Permanent battery supply current per pin', '3': '10'}, {'I in-total': 'Total load current, 12 V and 24 V battery operation', '4': '45'}, {'I <chunk_seperator> Byte 0 Byte 1 **Data bytes of the CAN message**

The following example will explain the storage position of the ""Little Endian"" format. For this purpose, the transmission of an *INTEGER16***, e.g. of a 16 bit signed integer number, is** 
shown in the data block of a CAN message (8 bytes). The value to be transmitted will be shown as a hexadecimal number in order to show more clearly how the number is assigned to the bytes within the data block. <chunk_seperator> Should the binary signal be a part of a BITFIELD, the data length is 1 bit.

## 2.4.4. Bitfield

The data type UNSIGNED is often used for the display of bitfields. In this case, each bit of the date has its own signification, although in many cases, not all bit positions are used. 

Each bit of the BITFIELD therefore corresponds with a signal of the data type *BOOLEAN*. <chunk_seperator> - **Limite de valeur de mesure**

 Question:  What is the starting position of byte positions within a data block?",The starting position of byte positions within a data block is 0.
"You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the context that the user gives to answer the question. Treat the context as your internal knowledge, hence do not explicitly mention the ""context"" in your answer like ""Based on the provided context..."".If your answer relates to any image description given below, you should refer explicitly to the image ID in your answer with the format [image_id.png].Give a long and detailed answer.","Context: In the protocol described, the first entry of the RECORD defines the highest existing subindex in the existing sections of a record. This entry always has a sub-index of 0 and is handled in a special way. The number of entries may be smaller than this value, as not all of the sub indices need to be used. In a RECORD, a maximum of 255 entries is allowed. The individual value entries are accessed via a sub-index. The first sub-index for a value entry is 1. If a sub-index is accessed which is of higher value than the content of the subindex 0 (number of valid RECORD entries), an error message will occur. The same applies when accessing a ""gap"" in the RECORD (a non-defined sub-index). <chunk_seperator> In case of a bitfield, a few indications can be set synchronously. Therefore, for the evaluation of an individual indication, an appropriate masking should be applied for the bit field. 

The comparison with a simple constant may fail when having a combination of indications.

Bit positions which are unused may take on fixed values (0/1), depending on internal application states, or shift between the states. For a reliable evaluation, these bit positions should therefore be ignored.

## 2.4.6. Array

ARRAY is a data type containing a variety of different entries/values. In an ARRAY, the entries are all of the same data type. The value entries in an ARRAY have the same signification but do not have the same content, i.e. a list of all the recently recorded device error numbers. For the individual entries, the simple data types described above, such as UNSIGNED32**, are used.** 
In the protocol described here, the first entry of the ARRAY indicates the number of existing entries. In an ARRAY, a maximum of 255 entries is allowed. This entry always has a subindex of 0 and is handled in a special way. <chunk_seperator> A RECORD is a data type containing a variety of different entries/values. In some programming languages this data type is also referred to as a structure. In contrast to an *ARRAY*, 
in the case of a RECORD, the individual entries may consist of different data types. The value entries in a RECORD therefore have different meanings and contents, i.e. *Device* code**. For the individual entries, the simple data types described above, such as** UNSIGNED32**, are used.** <chunk_seperator> The individual value entries are accessed via a sub-index. The first sub-index for a value entry is 1. If a sub-index is accessed which is of higher value than the content of the subindex 0 (number of valid ARRAY entries) an error message will occur.

## 5.4.1.3 Output Scaling

In the output scaling menu you can set the upper range of operating hours, the HYDACLAB sensor thus counts the operating hours. 

The output signal for the operating hours is scaled to a value set by the user, i.e. 4mA 0 operating hours and 20 mA 10000 operating hours. This figure defines the maximum expected operating hours of the system since its last reset. Upper range Arrhenius: The Arrhenius rate defines the operating hours depending on temperature, the weighting is based on the Arrhenius equation.
 Question:  What is the significance of each individual bit in a BITFIELD?","In a BITFIELD, each individual bit corresponds to a signal of the data type BOOLEAN. The significance of each individual bit is explained in the related description. This means that each bit in the BITFIELD has a specific meaning or function, and this meaning is defined elsewhere.

In a BITFIELD, each bit can have a binary value of either 0 (FALSE) or 1 (TRUE). When a bit is active, it means the corresponding characteristic or signal is active, and when it's inactive, the characteristic or signal is inactive.

For example, in an image representation of a BITFIELD, a bit with a binary numeric value of 1 (TRUE) is often displayed as a signal, as shown in [14_image_0.png]. This indicates that the corresponding characteristic is active.

It's essential to understand that the significance of each individual bit is defined separately, and this definition is used to interpret the BITFIELD. This allows multiple indications to be set simultaneously, making it possible to evaluate individual indications by applying a masking mechanism to the BITFIELD."

In a RECORD, a maximum of 255 entries is allowed. The individual value entries are accessed via a sub-index. The first sub-index for a value entry is 1.

This figure defines the maximum expected operating hours of the system since its last reset. Upper range Arrhenius: The Arrhenius rate defines the operating hours depending on temperature, the weighting is based on the Arrhenius equation.
 Question:  What is the significance of the first entry in a RECORD?","The significance of the first entry in a RECORD is that it defines the highest existing sub-index in the existing sections of the record. This entry always has a sub-index of 0 and is handled in a special way. It indicates the maximum number of valid entries in the RECORD, which may be smaller than the maximum allowed number of 255 entries. This means that not all of the sub-indices need to be used, and there might be gaps in the RECORD (non-defined sub-indices)."
"You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the context that the user gives to answer the question. Treat the context as your internal knowledge, hence do not explicitly mention the ""context"" in your answer like ""Based on the provided context..."".If your answer relates to any image description given below, you should refer explicitly to the image ID in your answer with the format [image_id.png].Give a long and detailed answer.","Context: In the protocol described, the first entry of the RECORD defines the highest existing subindex in the existing sections of a record. This entry always has a sub-index of 0 and is handled in a special way. The number of entries may be smaller than this value, as not all of the sub indices need to be used. In a RECORD, a maximum of 255 entries is allowed. The individual value entries are accessed via a sub-index. The first sub-index for a value entry is 1. If a sub-index is accessed which is of higher value than the content of the subindex 0 (number of valid RECORD entries), an error message will occur. The same applies when accessing a ""gap"" in the RECORD (a non-defined sub-index). <chunk_seperator> In case of a bitfield, a few indications can be set synchronously. Therefore, for the evaluation of an individual indication, an appropriate masking should be applied for the bit field. 

The comparison with a simple constant may fail when having a combination of indications.

Bit positions which are unused may take on fixed values (0/1), depending on internal application states, or shift between the states. For a reliable evaluation, these bit positions should therefore be ignored.

## 2.4.6. Array

ARRAY is a data type containing a variety of different entries/values. In an ARRAY, the entries are all of the same data type. The value entries in an ARRAY have the same signification but do not have the same content, i.e. a list of all the recently recorded device error numbers. For the individual entries, the simple data types described above, such as UNSIGNED32**, are used.** 
In the protocol described here, the first entry of the ARRAY indicates the number of existing entries. In an ARRAY, a maximum of 255 entries is allowed. This entry always has a subindex of 0 and is handled in a special way. <chunk_seperator> A RECORD is a data type containing a variety of different entries/values. In some programming languages this data type is also referred to as a structure. In contrast to an *ARRAY*, 
in the case of a RECORD, the individual entries may consist of different data types. The value entries in a RECORD therefore have different meanings and contents, i.e. *Device* code**. For the individual entries, the simple data types described above, such as** UNSIGNED32**, are used.** <chunk_seperator> The individual value entries are accessed via a sub-index. The first sub-index for a value entry is 1. If a sub-index is accessed which is of higher value than the content of the subindex 0 (number of valid ARRAY entries) an error message will occur. 

## 2.4.6.1. Example Array

<table_15>[{'Index': 'Sub', 'Value': 'Name', 'Type': 'Access'}, {'---------': '------------------', '--------': '----------'}, {'1003h': 'Pre-defined error field'}, {'1003h': '0', '4': 'Number of errors', 'VAR': 'rw'}]</table_15>

BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY OR OTHER LOSS WHATSOEVER) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE DOCUMENT EVEN IF TTCONTROL HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. <chunk_seperator> ## 2.4.7.1. Example Record

The following example shows the structure of a RECORD in the OD.

The significance of each individual bit is explained in the related description. 

Status signals are often displayed as a bitfield. The representation of the content of a bitfield is usually in binary format, i.e. bit-oriented. The relevant characteristic is active if the bit which is related to the characteristic is active,

The smaller square containing the letter ""I"" appears to be a close-up or a detailed view of the letter. It seems like this could be a logo or a design element for a company or organization that uses the letter I as part of its branding.) which means it has the binary numeric value of 1 (TRUE). <chunk_seperator> Overall, the image provides a clear visual explanation of various terms and concepts related to temperature, making it an informative reference for understanding these concepts better.) Notice: If the temperature range is changed during the reference cycle, NO reset needs to be performed, as HYDACLAB automatically adapts to the new range. 

## 5.4.1.3 Output Scaling

In the output scaling menu you can set the upper range of operating hours, the HYDACLAB sensor thus counts the operating hours. 

The output signal for the operating hours is scaled to a value set by the user, i.e. 4mA 0 operating hours and 20 mA 10000 operating hours. This figure defines the maximum expected operating hours of the system since its last reset.

This chapter is designed to give the user quick answers to frequently occurring questions. 

For this purpose, the information is presented in the most compact way and provides crossreferences to the related chapters for detailed information. 

## 3.1.1. Canopen Default Settings

The signals in the measurement system which are typically pre-set for the process value transmission are explained below. Default settings depend on the model code and may deviate from the settings explained herein, particularly in devices with a modification (see user manual chapter ""Model code""→ ""Modification number""). The individual signal properties are described in chapter *3.3 Process* **data** <chunk_seperator> Note **4 Ratiometric mode. This includes the conversion error of the HY-TTC 500 and the**
sensor supply error. For the calculation of the total measurement error, the error of HY-TTC 500 and the error of the ratiometric sensor (measurement tolerance) must be added.

Note **Configuration by application software**
Note 5 The total measurement error is the sum of zero reading error and the proportional error. <chunk_seperator> After calling IO_FLASH_Write(), the IO_FLASH_GetStatus() **function should be called periodically to check if the write operation has finished.**

This chapter is designed to give the user quick answers to frequently occurring questions. 

For this purpose, the information is presented in the most compact way and provides crossreferences to the related chapters for detailed information. 

## 3.1.1. Canopen Default Settings

The signals in the measurement system which are typically pre-set for the process value transmission are explained below. Default settings depend on the model code and may deviate from the settings explained herein, particularly in devices with a modification (see user manual chapter ""Model code""→ ""Modification number""). The individual signal properties are described in chapter *3.3 Process* **data** <chunk_seperator> Note **4 Ratiometric mode. This includes the conversion error of the HY-TTC 500 and the**
sensor supply error. For the calculation of the total measurement error, the error of HY-TTC 500 and the error of the ratiometric sensor (measurement tolerance) must be added.

Note **Configuration by application software**
Note 5 The total measurement error is the sum of zero reading error and the proportional error. <chunk_seperator> After calling IO_FLASH_Write(), the IO_FLASH_GetStatus() **function should be called periodically to check if the write operation has finished.**

 Question:  What is the purpose of the Event Timer in the measurement system?","The purpose of the Event Timer in the measurement system is to trigger specific events or actions at a predetermined time interval. In the provided example [table_19.png], the Event Timer is set to 1000 ms, which means it will trigger an event or action every 1000 milliseconds. This timer is used in conjunction with other parameters, such as the Transmission Type, to control the flow of data transmission in the measurement system.

In the context of the CANopen protocol, the Event Timer is used to schedule specific tasks or events, such as sending or receiving data, at a predetermined time interval. This allows for efficient and coordinated data exchange between devices in the measurement system.

For instance, in the example provided, the Event Timer is used in conjunction with the Transmission Type (TPDO1 and TPDO2) to control the transmission of data. The Event Timer triggers the transmission of data at a predetermined time interval, ensuring that data is sent or received in a coordinated manner.

In summary, the Event Timer plays a crucial role in the measurement system by enabling the scheduling of specific events or actions at a predetermined time interval, which is essential for efficient and coordinated data exchange between devices in the system."

Next, **enter the desired device address into Object 2003.2**. This is explained in the object ""Node ID"" and is part of chapter 4.6.1°SDO.

Then, **save changes to non-volatile device memory**. This is explained in the description ""Store parameters"" and is part of the object ""Save LSS parameters"".

Finally, **restart the device**. This is explained in chapter 4.4°Network Management, specifically in the section ""Reset node"" which is part of chapter 4.4.2 NMT. Alternatively, you can **cut device power supply and reconnect ""power cycle""**.

There is also an **alternative option for changing the node ID**. This is explained in chapter 4.7°Layer setting services (LSS) Protocol, specifically in chapter 4.7.7°Example: setting the node ID and Baud rate via LSS.

For example, in a CAN-Trace example, if you want to change the device address in a measurement system with an active device address 1 which is supposed to be changed to 10h (16d), you would follow these steps."

 Question:  What is the purpose of the offset in the signal properties, and how is it used in the calculation of the physical value?","The purpose of the offset in the signal properties is to provide an adjustment value to the numeric signal value during transmission. This offset is mainly used when the data type of the transmitted numeric value is unsigned. is essential to consider the offset to ensure accurate physical value representation.

In the calculation of the physical value, the offset is added to the numeric value. This is demonstrated in the example provided in Table 22: Numerical value: 61d, Measurement range: -40°C to +210°C, Resolution: 0.01°C/bit, Offset: -40°C (61d * 1°C/Bit) + (-40°C) = 21°C.

Here, the offset (-40°C) is added to the numeric value (61d) to obtain the physical value (21°C) that is displayable by the signal. The offset ensures that the physical value is accurately represented, considering the unsigned data type of the transmitted numeric value.

In summary, the offset in the signal properties serves as an adjustment value to guarantee accurate physical value representation when transmitting unsigned numeric values."

 Question:  How is the ""VFL status"" signal structured, and what information does it provide about the validity of the signal?","The ""VFL status"" signal is structured as a BITFIELD, which means it is a collection of individual bits that provide specific information about the validity of the signal. 

Each bit in the BITFIELD corresponds to a specific status or condition, and the value of the bit (0 or 1) indicates whether that condition is true or false. The meaning of each bit is defined in the BITFIELD description, which is not provided in the given context. However, it can be inferred that the BITFIELD status ""VFL status"" provides information about the validity of the signal, such as whether the measurement is valid, whether there are errors, or whether the signal is out of range.

The BITFIELD structure allows for a compact representation of multiple status flags, making it efficient for transmission over a CAN bus. The recipient of the signal can then evaluate the individual bits to determine the overall status of the signal.

In the context of the Virtual Fluid Lab (VFL), the ""VFL status"" signal is intended to be evaluated in combination with the ""remaining service life"" process value signal, as specified in the operating instructions. This suggests that the ""VFL status"" signal provides additional information about the validity or reliability of the ""remaining service life"" signal, which is essential for making informed decisions about maintenance or replacement of the filter element."

 Question:  What is the purpose of the resolution in the signal properties, and how is it used to define the conversion between the numeric value and the physical size of the signal?","The purpose of the resolution in the signal properties is to define the physical value of an individual bit of the numeric value. It is used to establish the conversion between the numeric value of the data type and the physical size of the signal.

In other words, the resolution specifies how much the physical value of the signal changes when the numeric value increases by one unit. For example, if the resolution is 0.01 °/bit, it means that the physical value of the signal increases by 0.01 ° when the numeric value increases by one bit.

To illustrate this, let's consider an example from the context. Suppose we have a numeric value of 4711d, and the resolution is 0.01 °/bit. To find the physical value of the signal, we can multiply the numeric value by the resolution: 4711d * 0.01 °/bit = 47.11 °. This means that the physical value of the signal is 47.11 °.

In another example, if the numeric value is 61d, the measurement range is -40 °C to +210 °C, and the resolution is 0.01 °C/bit, we can calculate the physical value as follows: first, we need to apply the offset, which is -40 °C in this case. Then, we multiply the numeric value by the resolution: (61d * 0.01 °C/bit) + (-40 °C) = 21 °C. This is the physical value of the signal.

In summary, the resolution in the signal properties is essential for defining the conversion between the numeric value and the physical size of the signal. It specifies how much the physical value changes when the numeric value increases by one unit, allowing us to calculate the physical value of the signal from the numeric value."

Basically, a short circuit would not be detected by the application software, but this condition would lead to a safe condition, anyway.

- Two identical potentiometers with different proportional factor at their outputs. That could mean, for example, that the one sensor outputs a value that is double the voltage of the second sensor, for any position. That way, the both sensors can never show the same output values at the same time, enabling the application software to detect short circuits between these sensor lines.

This could be, for example, a joystick containing two sensors with opposite characteristics. In its idle position, as well as when the sensor lines are shorted, it outputs sensor values of 50 %, each. Basically, a short circuit would not be detected by the application software, but this condition would lead to a safe condition, anyway.

- Two identical potentiometers with different proportional factor at their outputs. That could mean, for example, that the one sensor outputs a value that is double the voltage of the second sensor, for any position. That way, the both sensors can never show the same output values at the same time, enabling the application software to detect short circuits between these sensor lines.

![33_image_0.png]( The image displays a diagram with several boxes and lines, possibly representing a flowchart or a graphic representation of data. There are two main sections within this visual display, one on the left side and another on the right side. <chunk_seperator> Since this safety mechanism is able to detect only basic failure modes both internal and external to the HY-TTC 500 platform, the according diagnostic coverage is considered to be low, i.e. 60 %.

## 8.2.7 Timer Inputs (Io_Pwd_06 ... Io_Pwd_11)

Category: Comment ID: 959339 The HY-TTC 500 platform's timer inputs 06-11 (*IO_PWD_06 ... IO_PWD_11*) allow to directly measure the signals of dedicated frequency sensors with different output characteristics (e.g. PNP-type, NPNtype, current loop). However, due to their internal structure, these timer inputs **must not** be utilized safety-critically on their own in measurement modes timer input, encoder input or digital input.

Depending on the actual measurement mode, the execution of diverse safety measures might be 

feasible.
 Question:  What is the relationship between the ""Pressure"" status and the ""Pressure"" process value signal?","The relationship between the ""Pressure"" status and the ""Pressure"" process value signal is that the ""Pressure"" status provides information on the validity of the ""Pressure"" process value signal. In other words, the ""Pressure"" status indicates whether the ""Pressure"" process value signal is valid or not. 

This is evident from the flowchart or diagram shown in [32_image_0.png], which outlines a process with multiple steps, and the main focus is on the top section, which features a series of boxes labeled ""Process,"" ""Operations,"" and ""Transmission."" These boxes are connected by arrows, indicating the flow of the process. The presence of smaller boxes scattered throughout the diagram, some near the center and others towards the edges, suggests that these represent specific tasks or sub-processes within the overall process. 

The ""Pressure"" status, being a bit field, provides a way to evaluate the validity of the ""Pressure"" process value signal. As stated, for the intended use of the measurement system, the ""Pressure"" status should always be evaluated in combination with the ""Pressure"" process value signal (see operating instructions). This implies that the ""Pressure"" status and the ""Pressure"" process value signal are closely related, and the status provides additional information about the signal, specifically its validity."

 Question:  What is the purpose of the ""Operating data"" measured variable in this measurement system？","The purpose of the ""Operating data"" measured variable in this measurement system is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the overall description of the measurement system, it can be inferred that the ""Operating data"" refers to the nominal measured variable of the system, which is likely to be a critical parameter for the system's operation.

In the context of the provided tables and descriptions, the ""Operating data"" seems to be a central concept, and other signals and parameters are described in relation to it. For instance, the ""External temperature value"" signal is described as an input signal that provides additional information to the ""Operating data"". Similarly, the ""Device Temperature"" signal is described as an auxiliary measured variable that does not map any process data in the conventional sense.

Furthermore, the ""Operating data"" can also be reset via an RPDO or an SDO, suggesting that it is a critical parameter that needs to be monitored and controlled.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the purpose of the ""Operating data"" measured variable is to provide critical information about the system's operation, such as its performance, efficiency, or safety, and to enable the system to function properly."

The device provides the plant-side default of the parameters to configure the ""Pressure"" process value in the index range 21xxh. These values are copied into the object entries 6xxxh, 7xxxh and 9xxxh when resetting the measurement system to default settings.

Category: Comment ID: 924656 The current state of the digital low side outputs can be read via the static voltage feedback signals. That way, the application software is able to verify the correct function of the digital low side outputs and activate the safe state in case of dangerous failures. If the independent digital high side outputs are not used as secondary shut-off paths, the system integrator is responsible to provide other means that allow bringing the overall system to a safe state, e.g. by a separate emergency valve that disrupts the hydraulic oil flow and stops any dangerous movements. This safety mechanism allows to detect a substantial amount of possible hardware failures and—with a proper secondary shut-off path in place—is therefore considered to yield a DC value of 90 %.

 Question:  What is the purpose of Parameter 2, and what is its default setting?","According to the provided context, Parameter 2 is related to the ""Pressure"" process value in the index range 21xxh. Specifically, it is a temperature threshold from which the algorithm is active.

The default setting for Parameter 2 is **2 REAL32 rw**, which means it is a 32-bit real number with a read-write access type.

In essence, Parameter 2 serves as a threshold value that determines when the algorithm for processing the ""Pressure"" signal becomes active. The default setting of 2 indicates that the algorithm will be triggered when the temperature reaches a certain threshold value, which is represented as a 32-bit real number."

 Question:  What does the ""Signal characteristics"" table in section 3.5.5.1 describe?","The ""Signal characteristics"" table in section 3.5.5.1 describes the characteristics of the ""Device temperature"" signal. Specifically, it provides information about the input scaling, measurement range, and physical unit of the device temperature signal.

The table contains several entries, including:

1. MS input MV 2: This specifies the measured value (MV) of the device temperature signal, which is 4610, with a data type of REAL32 and an access type of ""ro"" (read-only).

2. MS input scaling 1 MV 1: This specifies the scaling factor for the device temperature signal, which is 4611, with a data type of REAL32 and an access type of ""ro"" (read-only).

3. Lower measuring range limit: This specifies the lower limit of the device temperature measurement range, which is -25°C.

4. Upper measuring range limit: This specifies the upper limit of the device temperature measurement range, which is 100°C.

5. MS status: This provides status information about the device temperature signal, with a data type of UNSIGNED8 and an access type of ""ro"" (read-only).

6. MS decimal digits: This specifies the number of decimal places of the device temperature signal, with a data type of UNSIGNED8 and an access type of ""rw"" (read-write).

7. MS physical unit: This specifies the physical unit of the device temperature signal, which is provided as an SI unit according to CiA 303-2, with a data type of UNSIGNED32 and an access type of ""ro"" (read-only).

Overall, the ""Signal characteristics"" table provides detailed information about the device temperature signal, including its measurement range, scaling, and physical unit."

See chapter *4.5.4.3 Storage and restoring (general communication objects).* <chunk_seperator> ## 8.2.10.1 Voltage Monitoring

Category: Comment ID: 924656 The current state of the digital low side outputs can be read via the static voltage feedback signals. That way, the application software is able to verify the correct function of the digital low side outputs and activate the safe state in case of dangerous failures. If the independent digital high side outputs are not used as secondary shut-off paths, the system integrator is responsible to provide other means that allow bringing the overall system to a safe state, e.g. by a separate emergency valve that disrupts the hydraulic oil flow and stops any dangerous movements. This safety mechanism allows to detect a substantial amount of possible hardware failures and—with a proper secondary shut-off path in place—is therefore considered to yield a DC value of 90 %.

 Question:  What is the significance of the ""Error behavior"" object, and how does it relate to communication errors or manufacturer-specific errors?","The ""Error behavior"" object, as described in the context, is a crucial component in the device profile ""CiA 404 Device profile for measuring devices and closed-loop controllers"". This object plays a vital role in managing errors that occur during communication or are specific to the manufacturer.

The ""Error behavior"" object is an array (1029h) that provides general information about error management, as outlined in chapter 4.5.4.1 of the documentation. This object is responsible for describing the error behavior in case of an internal device error or a communication error.

In the event of a communication error or a manufacturer-specific error, the generic error is set. The ""Error behavior"" object then takes over to manage this error. It provides information on how the device should behave in such scenarios, ensuring that the device responds appropriately to the error.

The significance of the ""Error behavior"" object lies in its ability to handle errors in a controlled manner, preventing the device from malfunctioning or providing incorrect data. By defining the error behavior, the device can be configured to respond to errors in a way that minimizes disruptions to the measurement process.

In relation to communication errors or manufacturer-specific errors, the ""Error behavior"" object serves as a fallback mechanism. When a communication error occurs, the device can refer to the ""Error behavior"" object to determine the appropriate course of action. This ensures that the device can recover from the error and resume normal operation.

In summary, the ""Error behavior"" object is a critical component in the device profile that enables the device to manage errors effectively, ensuring reliable operation and minimizing the impact of communication errors or manufacturer-specific errors on the measurement process."

 Question:  What is the purpose of the ""AI input scaling"" objects, and how do they scale the process values of the measured variables?","The ""AI input scaling"" objects serve the purpose of scaling the process values of the measured variables. These objects are used to convert the raw sensor data into a meaningful physical unit, such as pressure, temperature, or flow rate.

The ""AI input scaling"" objects consist of three sub-objects: AI input scaling 1 FV, AI input scaling 1 PV, and AI input scaling 2 FV. Each of these sub-objects has a specific function in the scaling process.

AI input scaling 1 FV (6120h) is used to scale the field value of the measured variable. It takes the raw sensor data as input and applies a scaling factor to convert it into a physical unit. The scaled value is then used as the process value.

AI input scaling 1 PV (6121h) is used to scale the process value of the measured variable. It takes the scaled value from AI input scaling 1 FV and applies another scaling factor to convert it into a more meaningful physical unit. The final scaled value is then used as the output of the measurement system.

AI input scaling 2 FV (6122h) is used to further refine the scaling of the process value. It takes the scaled value from AI input scaling 1 PV and applies another scaling factor to convert it into an even more precise physical unit.

In summary, the ""AI input scaling"" objects are used to scale the raw sensor data into meaningful physical units, such as pressure, temperature, or flow rate. They consist of three sub-objects that apply successive scaling factors to convert the raw data into a final scaled value that is used as the output of the measurement system."

## Specifications
 Question:  What is the purpose of the ""Upper value of the field value"" with a value of 5000?","The purpose of the ""Upper value of the field value"" with a value of 5000 is to scale the process value ""Pressure"" to a specific range. This value is used to set the upper limit for scaling the process value, which is 5000 in this case. This means that the sensor's measuring range is up to 5000 bar. 

When the process value ""Pressure"" is scaled, it is converted from its original value to a value within the range of 0 to 5000. This is done to ensure that the process value is within a specific range, making it easier to work with and transmit. 

For example, if the sensor measures a pressure of 4000 bar, it would be scaled to a value within the range of 0 to 5000, which would be a value close to 4000. This scaled value is then transmitted or used for further processing. 

It's also important to note that a unit change automatically leads to a change in the scaling values of the process value, which means that if the unit of measurement is changed from bar to psi, for instance, the scaling values would also change accordingly."

## Specifications
 Question:  How does a unit change affect the scaling values of the process value 6121h and 6123h?","A unit change automatically leads to a change in the scaling values of the process value 6121h and 6123h. This means that when the physical unit of the process value is modified, the scaling values associated with the process value, specifically 6121h and 6123h, are also updated accordingly. 

For instance, if the unit is changed from bar to psi, the scaling values will be recalculated to ensure that the process value is correctly represented in the new unit. This is essential to maintain the accuracy and consistency of the process value, as it is used in various calculations and transmissions throughout the system. 

In the context of the provided information, the scaling values 6121h and 6123h are used to scale the ""Pressure"" process value. The upper value for scaling the process value ""Pressure"" is 5000, and the AI input scaling 2 FV is 6122h. Similarly, the AI input scaling 2 PV is 6123h, which is used to scale the ""Pressure"" process value with an upper value of 600. 

Therefore, a unit change will impact the scaling values of 6121h and 6123h, ensuring that the process value is correctly represented in the new unit, whether it is bar, psi, or any other unit. This automatic update of scaling values is crucial to maintain the system's integrity and prevent errors that might arise from inconsistent unit representations."

The cable resistance adds to the rotor resistance of the motor. While the impact of a small voltage drop is negligible for normal operation it can be helpful to reduce inrush current when switching on the motor. If there is significant cable length used for motor **cabling, please add the wire resistance** to the motor current classification to relax need of paralleling power stages. For power stages operated in parallel please observe that this cable resistance also helps to equally distribute the load current over the power stages. On the other hand, if there is significant difference in wire length of paralleled output stages this enhances non-symmetric load, which means one power stage might carry significant more load current than the others. This ends up in reduced power capability. 4 power stages of the HY-TTC 500 would theoretically deliver **a total current of 16 A if switched on** concurrently.
 Question:  What happens to the *ProcessValue* if it exceeds the limit value?","If the current *ProcessValue* exceeds the limit value, a bit is set in the status. This is explained in chapter 3.3.3.1, which describes the design of the BITFIELD ""VFL status"". 

In other words, when the *ProcessValue* surpasses the predetermined limit, a specific bit is triggered or set in the status, indicating that the limit has been exceeded. This status information is crucial in evaluating the signal and determining the necessary actions to be taken. 

For instance, in the context of the ""VFL operating data"" signal, if the current remaining lifetime (signal ""Rest lifetime"" [image_id: 47]) exceeds the limit value, a bit is set in the ""VFL status"" [image_id: 45], indicating that the remaining lifetime has fallen below a certain threshold. Similarly, if the current operating hours (signal ""Operating hours"" [image_id: 47]) exceed the limit, another bit is set in the ""VFL status"", signaling that the operating hours have reached a critical point. 

This mechanism allows for efficient monitoring and control of the process values, enabling the system to respond promptly to any deviations from the expected range."

The cable resistance adds to the rotor resistance of the motor. While the impact of a small voltage drop is negligible for normal operation it can be helpful to reduce inrush current when switching on the motor. If there is significant cable length used for motor **cabling, please add the wire resistance** to the motor current classification to relax need of paralleling power stages. For power stages operated in parallel please observe that this cable resistance also helps to equally distribute the load current over the power stages. On the other hand, if there is significant difference in wire length of paralleled output stages this enhances non-symmetric load, which means one power stage might carry significant more load current than the others. This ends up in reduced power capability. 4 power stages of the HY-TTC 500 would theoretically deliver **a total current of 16 A if switched on** concurrently.

 Question:  What is the purpose of the manufacturer-specific process value parameters in this case?","The purpose of the manufacturer-specific process value parameters in this case is to calculate the remaining service life. These parameters are used to configure the ""Fluid temperature"" signal, which is an input signal in °C or °F, and the ""Pressure value"" signal, which provides information on the validity of the signal. The parameters also include the ""VFL operating data"" and ""VFL status"" signals, which are used to determine the remaining lifetime in hours.

In particular, the manufacturer-specific process value parameters are used to:

1. Configure the ""Fluid temperature"" signal, which is an input signal in °C or °F, to determine the external fluid temperature.
2. Calculate the remaining service life based on the ""VFL operating data"" and ""VFL status"" signals.
3. Provide information on the validity of the ""Pressure value"" signal.

These parameters are specific to the manufacturer and are used to customize the calculation of the remaining service life based on the specific requirements of the device.

The tables and images provided, such as [image_48.png] and [image_49.png], illustrate the relationships between the different signals and parameters, and how they are used to calculate the remaining service life. The tables, such as table_45, table_46, and table_47, provide detailed information on the parameters, including their data types, measurement ranges, and default values.

Overall, the purpose of the manufacturer-specific process value parameters is to provide a customized solution for calculating the remaining service life based on the specific requirements of the device."

There are three different ways to perform a reset of the sensor. Reset to default settings means that all settings in the device are set back to its delivered status.

Reset reference cycle (see 7.1) means that all settings will be kept, except for the reference cycle data. Therefore, the reference cycle must be performed again, i.e. after an oil change. Reset log means that the fit table is kept but the data storage is cleared.

CAN is a Bus system. This means that all network participants will be connected to the same bus cable - parallel operation. On the contrary, the Ethernet, which is usually used in office communication, only connects one participant with one other at one time. For the connection between several participants, additional hardware, i.e. a switch, is necessary. This effort is not **necessary using CAN. How the network has to be organised is described in the following** chapter 4.2.3 *Topology*. 

CAN mainly has 2 signal lines: CAN-H and CAN-L. Data transmission is performed via these two lines, see chapter 4.2.2 *Signal* **level.** 
Each network participant is equal **in a CAN network, which means that each of the participants is able and allowed to send messages. If a participant sends, all the others receive**

CAN_SHLD serves as a connecction of a shielding for the signal line. Generally, the CAN signal lines do not require any shielding. 

Potential loss between network participants should be avoided. They may damage the wire connections or the electronic unit. The connection CAN_GND is not intended for equipotential bonding.

 Question:  What is the main difference between CAN bus system and Ethernet, as described in chapter 4.2 Hardware Properties?","The main difference between the CAN bus system and Ethernet, as described in chapter 4.2 Hardware Properties, lies in their connection and communication approaches. 

In a CAN bus system, all network participants are connected to the same bus cable, allowing for parallel operation. This means that multiple devices can be connected to the same bus, and they can all send and receive messages simultaneously. This is in contrast to Ethernet, which is typically used in office communication and only connects one participant with one other at a time. In Ethernet, additional hardware, such as a switch, is necessary to facilitate connections between multiple participants.

In other words, CAN bus system is a multi-point connection system, whereas Ethernet is a point-to-point connection system. This fundamental difference in connection architecture has significant implications for the way data is transmitted and received in these two systems.

Furthermore, the CAN bus system's ability to prioritize messages based on their CAN ID ensures that collisions are avoided, and messages are transmitted efficiently. This is not the case in Ethernet, where collisions can occur, and additional mechanisms are required to handle them.

Overall, the CAN bus system's design enables efficient, reliable, and prioritized communication between multiple devices, making it well-suited for applications that require real-time data exchange, such as in industrial automation or automotive systems."

## 4.2. Hardware Properties <chunk_seperator> ## 4.2. Hardware Properties

CAN is a Bus system. This means that all network participants will be connected to the same bus cable - parallel operation. On the contrary, the Ethernet, which is usually used in office communication, only connects one participant with one other at one time. For the connection between several participants, additional hardware, i.e. a switch, is necessary. This effort is not **necessary using CAN. How the network has to be organised is described in the following** chapter 4.2.3 *Topology*. 

CAN mainly has 2 signal lines: CAN-H and CAN-L. Data transmission is performed via these two lines, see chapter 4.2.2 *Signal* **level.** 
Each network participant is equal **in a CAN network, which means that each of the participants is able and allowed to send messages. If a participant sends, all the others receive** 
the message and decide on their own if it is relevant for them or not. <chunk_seperator> Almost all CAN connections provide an additional CAN_GND und CAN_SHLD. CAN_GND 

![58_image_0.png]( The image features a black and white icon of an ""I"" on a white background. The icon is placed inside a blue square or box, which adds contrast to the overall design. This simple yet elegant design can be used for various purposes, including branding, web design, or even as a decorative element in a room.) corresponds with a signal mass and can be used to bring the reference potential of the network participants to one common level. CAN_SHLD serves as a connecction of a shielding for the signal line. Generally, the CAN signal lines do not require any shielding. 

Potential loss between network participants should be avoided. They may damage the wire connections or the electronic unit. The connection CAN_GND is not intended for equipotential bonding.

## 4.2.2. Signal Level <chunk_seperator> ## 3.8. Lss Protocol Support

All measurement systems of the VFL VD and V1/4 series support the LSS protocol in the way described in chapter 4.7 Layer setting services (LSS) Protocol.

## 4. Protocol Description Canopen

Below, please find the description of the CANopen protocol used by the measurement system. Device-specific settings and behaviour are described in the different subsections in chapter *3 Product* **interface.** 

## 4.1. General

The various original documents which have been used for the implementation of the device 

![57_image_0.png]( The image features a black and white letter I on a blue background. It appears to be an icon or symbol rather than text. The letter is large and occupies most of the space within the frame, making it the focal point of the image.) can be found in the operation manual. 

The following description makes no claim **to be complete, its only aim is** <chunk_seperator> As one participant, which is sending, will directly read back each written bit, it can also recognise its own message has been overwritten, and will immediately discontinue further data transmission. The participant who has interrupted transmission, will try to reinitialise its transmission after the higher prioritised message has been sent. In doing this, no messages will be lost. 

## 4.2.1. Wire Connections

CAN does not require any complicated wire connections. For the connection of the network participants one drilled pair of wires should be used. The pair of wires serves for the transmission of the signals CAN-H and CAN-L. Non-drilled cables should be avoided. The recommended core diameter depends on the length and has an average between 0.34 and 0.6 mm2. 

Almost all CAN connections provide an additional CAN_GND und CAN_SHLD. CAN_GND
 Question:  What is the purpose of the CAN_GND and CAN_SHLD connections in a CAN network, as described in chapter 4.2.1 Wire Connections?","The purpose of the CAN_GND and CAN_SHLD connections in a CAN network, as described in chapter 4.2.1 Wire Connections, is to provide additional functionality to the network.

CAN_GND, which corresponds to a signal mass, is used to bring the reference potential of the network participants to one common level. This is important to ensure that all devices in the network are operating at the same voltage level, which helps to prevent potential losses and damage to the wire connections or electronic units.

CAN_SHLD, on the other hand, serves as a connection for a shielding for the signal line. Although the CAN signal lines do not typically require shielding, this connection provides an additional layer of protection against electromagnetic interference (EMI) and ensures reliable data transmission.

In summary, the CAN_GND connection helps to establish a common reference potential among network participants, while the CAN_SHLD connection provides shielding for the signal line to prevent electromagnetic interference and ensure reliable data transmission.

Referring to the images provided, [57_image_0.png] and [57_image_1.png] do not seem to be directly related to the CAN_GND and CAN_SHLD connections. However, [58_image_0.png] appears to be an icon or symbol, possibly representing the CAN_GND connection.

It is essential to note that the connection CAN_GND is not intended for equipotential bonding, which means it should not be used to connect the protective earth (PE) or other safety-related connections. This is crucial to avoid potential losses and damage to the wire connections or electronic units."

is carried out via the CAN ID, where the CAN ID 0 has the highest priority, see chapter *4.3.2* Meaning of the **CAN ID**. 

A network participant is not allowed to send, before a message has not been transmitted completely. If two participants start sending at the same time, the participant having the higher priority message will always ""win"". The structure of a message is described in chapter 4.3.1 *Structure principle of a* **CAN data message.** 
Transmission of information is bit-oriented in CAN networks and has a recessive and a dominant signal status. The dominant signal status is enabled to overwrite the recessive one. <chunk_seperator> ## 5.4.8 Reset 

![35_Image_2.Png](35_Image_2.Png)

There are three different ways to perform a reset of the sensor. Reset to default settings means that all settings in the device are set back to its delivered status.

Reset reference cycle (see 7.1) means that all settings will be kept, except for the reference cycle data. Therefore, the reference cycle must be performed again, i.e. after an oil change. Reset log means that the fit table is kept but the data storage is cleared.

 Question:  How does the CAN protocol ensure that no messages are lost in case of a collision, as described in chapter 4.2 Hardware Properties?","The CAN protocol ensures that no messages are lost in case of a collision by prioritizing messages. When multiple participants attempt to send messages simultaneously, CAN starts prioritizing messages based on their CAN ID. The message with the highest priority, which is the one with the lowest CAN ID, is sent first. This prevents collisions from occurring, unlike in other systems. 

In a CAN network, each participant is equal and allowed to send messages. When a participant sends a message, all other participants receive it and decide on their own whether it is relevant to them or not. If a collision occurs, CAN's prioritization mechanism ensures that the message with the highest priority is sent first, preventing data loss. This is a key feature of the CAN protocol, which enables reliable data transmission even in the presence of competing access from multiple participants."

As explained in chapter *4.2 Hardware* properties, **the topology of CAN is the Bus. This means, the CAN has a direct connection line, which reaches from the first to the last participant.** 
Each individual participant is directly connected to the signal lines CAN-H and CAN-L. At both ends of the main bus (the longest direct connection line) the bus line has to be terminated using a resistance of 120 Ohm. 

For the length of the main bus as well as for the length of the individual stub cable between the bus and the network participants, the maximum line lengths, described in chapter *4.2.5* Transmission **speed, should be strictly adhered to.** 

![59_image_1.png]( The image shows a diagram of an electrical system with multiple lines and connections. There are several busbars labeled ""busline"" that connect different parts of the system. Some of these buslines include ""busline 1,"" ""busline 2,"" and ""busline 3."" <chunk_seperator> ## 4.2.2. Signal Level

For the transmission, a symmetric voltage signal is used. This signal type has no direct reference with a signal mass, but only the voltage difference between both signal lines will be evaluated. This type of signal transmission has significant benefits in the case of interfering signals, as these will affect both signal lines equally and will be excluded at the subtraction. 

In the event of a dominant signal the signal line CAN-H will move to a higher voltage level and the CAN-L signal line will move to a lower voltage level.

 Question:  What type of signal transmission is used in the CAN protocol, and what are its benefits in the case of interfering signals?","The type of signal transmission used in the CAN (Controller Area Network) protocol is a symmetric voltage signal transmission. This type of signal transmission has no direct reference to a signal mass, but only the voltage difference between both signal lines (CAN-H and CAN-L) will be evaluated. 

The benefits of this type of signal transmission in the case of interfering signals are significant. Since the interfering signals will affect both signal lines equally, they will be excluded at the subtraction. This means that the interfering signals will not have any impact on the transmission, ensuring a reliable and robust communication between the network participants. 

In other words, the symmetric voltage signal transmission used in the CAN protocol provides a high degree of immunity to electromagnetic interference (EMI), which is essential in automotive and industrial applications where electromagnetic noise is prevalent. This is evident from the diagram signal level CAN-high-speed [58_image_1.png], which shows the voltage levels of the CAN-H and CAN-L signal lines."

As explained in chapter *4.2 Hardware* properties, **the topology of CAN is the Bus. This means, the CAN has a direct connection line, which reaches from the first to the last participant.** 
Each individual participant is directly connected to the signal lines CAN-H and CAN-L. At both ends of the main bus (the longest direct connection line) the bus line has to be terminated using a resistance of 120 Ohm. 

For the length of the main bus as well as for the length of the individual stub cable between the bus and the network participants, the maximum line lengths, described in chapter *4.2.5* Transmission **speed, should be strictly adhered to.**

Some of these buslines include ""busline 1,"" ""busline 2,"" and ""busline 3."" <chunk_seperator> ## 4.2.2. Signal Level

For the transmission, a symmetric voltage signal is used. This signal type has no direct reference with a signal mass, but only the voltage difference between both signal lines will be evaluated. This type of signal transmission has significant benefits in the case of interfering signals, as these will affect both signal lines equally and will be excluded at the subtraction. 

In the event of a dominant signal the signal line CAN-H will move to a higher voltage level and the CAN-L signal line will move to a lower voltage level.

 Question:  What happens to the signal lines CAN-H and CAN-L in the event of a dominant signal, and what is the resulting difference voltage?","In the event of a dominant signal, the signal line CAN-H will move to a higher voltage level, and the signal line CAN-L will move to a lower voltage level. As a result, the difference voltage between CAN-H and CAN-L will be approximately 2V. This is illustrated in the diagram signal level CAN-high-speed [58_image_1.png], which shows the voltage levels of the CAN-H and CAN-L signal lines in response to dominant and recessive signal statuses."

 Question:  What is the topology of the CAN protocol, and how are the individual participants connected to the signal lines?","The topology of the CAN (Controller Area Network) protocol is a Bus topology. This means that the CAN has a direct connection line, which reaches from the first to the last participant. Each individual participant is directly connected to the signal lines CAN-H (High) and CAN-L (Low). At both ends of the main bus (the longest direct connection line), the bus line has to be terminated using a resistance of 120 Ohm.

In a CAN network, each participant is connected to the signal lines CAN-H and CAN-L through a stub cable. The length of the main bus, as well as the length of the individual stub cable between the bus and the network participants, should strictly adhere to the maximum line lengths described in chapter 4.2.5 Transmission Speed.

This bus topology allows for multiple participants to be connected to the same bus, enabling communication between them. The CAN protocol uses a differential voltage signal, where the voltage difference between the CAN-H and CAN-L signal lines is evaluated. This makes the signal transmission more resistant to interference, as interfering signals will affect both signal lines equally and will be excluded at the subtraction.

The diagram [59_image_1.png] illustrates the bus topology of the CAN protocol, showing multiple bus lines connecting different parts of the system. The image also features nodes, which represent the individual participants connected to the bus lines.

In summary, the topology of the CAN protocol is a Bus topology, where each individual participant is directly connected to the signal lines CAN-H and CAN-L, and the main bus is terminated with a resistance of 120 Ohm at both ends. This allows for multiple participants to communicate with each other, and the differential voltage signal transmission makes the system more resistant to interference."

 **DSUB 9 pole socket for controllers (PC or PLC).** <chunk_seperator> 4.2.2.2. Diagram signal logic 

![59_image_0.png]( The image displays a graph with two lines, one labeled ""True"" and the other labeled ""Reciprocal."" The line labeled ""True"" is positioned above the line labeled ""Reciprocal,"" indicating that it represents a higher value or dominance in comparison to the reciprocal line. This relationship between the two lines suggests that the true value can be derived from the reciprocal value, and vice versa. The graph provides an insight into the relationship between these two variables, helping to understand their interdependence better.)

## 4.2.3. Topology <chunk_seperator> The CPU is connected to the memory through a series of arrows, indicating that data flows between these two components. The memory is further divided into different sections, such as the cache and main memory, which are essential for efficient processing in the computer system.)

TO USE THE SAMPLE ONLY IN A LABORATORY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DEVELOPMENT. IN
NO EVENT IS THE RECIPIENT ALLOWED TO USE THE SAMPLE FOR THE PURPOSE OF SERIES MANUFACTURING. <chunk_seperator> ## 4.2.3. Topology

As explained in chapter *4.2 Hardware* properties, **the topology of CAN is the Bus. This means, the CAN has a direct connection line, which reaches from the first to the last participant.** 
Each individual participant is directly connected to the signal lines CAN-H and CAN-L. At both ends of the main bus (the longest direct connection line) the bus line has to be terminated using a resistance of 120 Ohm. 

For the length of the main bus as well as for the length of the individual stub cable between the bus and the network participants, the maximum line lengths, described in chapter *4.2.5* Transmission **speed, should be strictly adhered to.** 

![59_image_1.png]( The image shows a diagram of an electrical system with multiple lines and connections. There are several busbars labeled ""busline"" that connect different parts of the system. Some of these buslines include ""busline 1,"" ""busline 2,"" and ""busline 3."" <chunk_seperator> ## 4.2.2. Signal Level

For the transmission, a symmetric voltage signal is used. This signal type has no direct reference with a signal mass, but only the voltage difference between both signal lines will be evaluated. This type of signal transmission has significant benefits in the case of interfering signals, as these will affect both signal lines equally and will be excluded at the subtraction. 

In the event of a dominant signal the signal line CAN-H will move to a higher voltage level and the CAN-L signal line will move to a lower voltage level. 

4.2.2.1. Diagram signal level CAN-high-speed 

![58_image_1.png]( The image depicts a graph with two lines on it, one blue and one red. The blue line is labeled ""CAN"" while the red line is labeled ""NH.""

 Question:  What are the three sections that a data message in a CAN network consists of, and what is the purpose of each section?","A data message in a CAN network consists of three sections: HEADER, DATA, and FOOTER. 

The **HEADER** section is responsible for synchronizing between the network participants and informing the receiver about the content and the length of the message. This section plays a crucial role in ensuring that all participants in the network are aware of the message being transmitted and its characteristics.

The **DATA** section is where the user data is stored. This is the information that is supposed to be transmitted from the sender to the receiver. The amount of data bytes in this section is defined by the DLC (Data Length Code) of the HEADER, which can receive values from 0 to 8. This means that the maximum length of the user data is 8 bytes or 64 bits.

The **FOOTER** section contains the checksum, a message confirmation, as well as an identifier that marks the end of the entire message. This section is essential for ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the transmitted data, as it allows the receiver to verify that the message has been received correctly.

In summary, the three sections of a data message in a CAN network work together to ensure reliable and efficient data transmission between network participants.

![62_image_2.png]( The image is a blue and white screen with text displayed on it. The text reads ""Can-I-In"" in bold letters. There are no other visible elements or graphics within the frame of the image.) The length of the entire message depends on two factors: The number of user data in the first place and the length of the CAN ID in the second; see chapter4.3.2 *Meaning of the* **CAN** ID.
 Question:  What is the maximum length of user data in a CAN message, and how is this length defined?","The maximum length of user data in a CAN message is 8 bytes or 64 bits. This length is defined by the Data Length Code (DLC) in the HEADER section of the CAN message. The DLC informs the receiver about the amount of data bytes in the DATA section, and it can receive applicable values ranging from 0 to 8. This means that the maximum length of user data is 8 bytes or 64 bits.

In a CAN message, the DLC is used to specify the number of bytes in the DATA section. The DLC is a part of the HEADER section, and it is used to synchronize the message transmission between the network participants. The DLC value ranges from 0 to 8, indicating the number of bytes in the DATA section. For example, if the DLC is 3, it means that the DATA section contains 3 bytes of user data.

It's worth noting that the length of the entire CAN message depends on two factors: the number of user data bytes and the length of the CAN ID. The CAN ID is used to identify the message and its priority, and it can be 11 bits or 29 bits long, depending on the CAN protocol implementation.

## 4.3.2. Meaning Of The Can Id

As described in the chapter 4.2 *Hardware* properties, **CAN is able to prioritise incoming** 
messages. The CAN ID is decisive for that. It is sent within the first section of the HEADER, 
as has been treated in chapter 4.3.1 *Structure principle of a* **CAN data message. As the** 
network participant may not send before complete transmission of a message, the CAN ID can be used to prioritise, applying the mechanism of the recessive and the dominant signal <chunk_seperator> load current (f = 444. . . 1000 Hz)', '4': '1'}, {'Ipeak': 'Peak load current limit', '5': '5.5'}, {'Rload_min Minimum coil resistance (12 V)': '6', '2': 'Ω'}, {'Rload_min Minimum coil resistance (24 V)': '6', '4': 'Ω'}, {'Rload_max Maximum load resistance': '7', '1': 'kΩ'}]</table_142>
 Question:  What is the transmission time per message in microseconds if the message length is 129 bits and the bus load is approximately 90%?","The transmission time per message is 516 microseconds. This is calculated based on the message length of 129 bits and the bus speed of 250 kbit/s, which results in a transmission time of 4 microseconds per bit. Therefore, the total transmission time per message would be 129 bits * 4 microseconds/bit = 516 microseconds. Additionally, with a bus load of approximately 90%, the system can handle around 1760 messages per second."

The CAN ID is sent within the first section of the header, and it is used to prioritize messages, applying the mechanism of recessive and dominant signals. The priority of a message depends on the value of the CAN ID. 

The CAN ID is not a direct address of participants in the network. Instead, it defines the importance of a message, thus, the CAN ID 0 has the highest possible priority. This is evident in the NMT message, which is used for network management, and has been assigned the most important priority.

message) to each individual participant (device) to change their state, NMT = Network M**anagement.** 
The ""Network Control"" service is performed via the *Master - Device***communication model.** 
The CANopen Manager (controller) generally takes over the role of the NMT Master As this service makes the decisions on the interaction between the participants in the network, it has been assigned the most important priority; see chapter 4.3.2 *Meaning of the* CAN ID and 4.3.1 *Structure principle of a* **CAN data message.**

## 4.3.2. Meaning Of The Can Id

As described in the chapter 4.2 *Hardware* properties, **CAN is able to prioritise incoming** 
messages. The CAN ID is decisive for that. It is sent within the first section of the HEADER, 
as has been treated in chapter 4.3.1 *Structure principle of a* **CAN data message. As the** 
network participant may not send before complete transmission of a message, the CAN ID can be used to prioritise, applying the mechanism of the recessive and the dominant signal <chunk_seperator> load current (f = 444. . . 1000 Hz)', '4': '1'}, {'Ipeak': 'Peak load current limit', '5': '5.5'}, {'Rload_min Minimum coil resistance (12 V)': '6', '2': 'Ω'}, {'Rload_min Minimum coil resistance (24 V)': '6', '4': 'Ω'}, {'Rload_max Maximum load resistance': '7', '1': 'kΩ'}]</table_142>
 Question:  What is the structure of a CAN data message, and what is the significance of the first section of the header?","The structure of a CAN data message consists of several sections, including the Header, Data Field, and Trailer. The Header is further divided into two parts: the arbitration field and the control field. The arbitration field contains the CAN ID, which is used to prioritize incoming messages. The control field contains information about the message, such as the data length code (DLC) and the data field length.

The first section of the Header is the arbitration field, which contains the CAN ID. This CAN ID is decisive for prioritizing incoming messages. The CAN ID is sent within the first section of the Header, and it determines the priority of the message. The lower the CAN ID, the higher the priority of the message. CAN ID = 0 has the highest possible priority.

In the context of CANopen, the CAN ID can be structured to combine the importance (service ID) with the participant's address. For example, the CAN ID of the first process data object is defined by 180h + Node ID.

The CAN ID is used to prioritize messages, and it plays a crucial role in the network management. The NMT message, which is used for network management, has the highest priority and is identified by the CAN ID 0."

 Question:  What is the data length of the NMT message, and what is the significance of each byte?","The NMT message has a data length of 2 bytes, each of which has a particular significance. 

Byte 0 signifies the command, and it can have one of the following values: 

- 01h: Start node - The participant is supposed to switch to ""Operational"" state. 
- 02h: Stop node - The participant is supposed to switch to ""Stopped"" state. 
- 80h: Enter Pre-Operational - The participant is supposed to switch to ""Preoperational"" state. 
- 81h: Reset node - The participant is supposed to be reinitialized. 

Byte 1 signifies the Node ID, and it can have one of the following values: 

- 0d: Message is being processed by all participants. 
- 1-127d: Node ID of the participant to be changed. 

In the example given, the NMT Master sends a signal to all network participants to change to ""Operational"" state, which is represented as NMT ""Start all nodes"". The corresponding message would be CAN ID = 0, Byte 0 = 01h, and Byte 1 = 0d. 

In the heartbeat protocol, the message needs to be activated explicitly and is sent on a cyclical basis. The heartbeat can be activated and the repeat rate can be configured via the object ""Producer heartbeat time"". Should the heartbeat consumer report the absence of a heartbeat message, it will inform its superordinate about this in the appropriate way.

 Question:  What is the purpose of the heartbeat protocol in the network, and how is it implemented?","The purpose of the heartbeat protocol in the network is to serve one participant to inform all the participants within the network about its current operating state. This service is implemented according to the 4.3.5.1 Producer - Consumer model. The message needs to be activated explicitly and is sent on a cyclical basis. Via the object ""Producer"" heartbeat time, the heartbeat can be activated and the repeat rate can be configured. Should the heartbeat consumer report the absence of a heartbeat message, it will inform its superordinate application software about this event. The application should then react in the appropriate way. The message has a data length of one byte, which reports the current state of the participant."

 Question:  What is the difference between the ""Operational"" and ""Pre-Operational"" states of a participant in the network?","The difference between the ""Operational"" and ""Pre-Operational"" states of a participant in the network lies in their functionality and readiness to operate.

In the ""Operational"" state, the participant is fully functional and ready to perform its designated tasks. This state is indicated by the byte value '01h' in the NMT message, as shown in [table_60.png]. When a participant is in this state, it means it has successfully initialized and is ready to receive and process data.

On the other hand, the ""Pre-Operational"" state is a transitional state where the participant is preparing to become operational. This state is indicated by the byte value '80h' in the NMT message, as shown in [table_60.png]. In this state, the participant is not yet fully functional, but it is in the process of initializing and preparing to become operational.

In the context of the heartbeat protocol, the ""Operational"" state is reported by the participant as '7Fh' (as shown in [table_63.png]), indicating that it is currently in the operational mode. In contrast, the ""Pre-Operational"" state is reported as '7Fh' with a different byte value, indicating that the participant is in the pre-operational mode.

In the example scenario described in section 4.4.4, the participant (Node ID = 1) is initially in the ""Operational"" state, then transitions to the ""Pre-Operational"" state, and finally to the ""Stopped"" state. This transition is initiated by the NMT Master, which sends signals to the participant to change its state.

In summary, the key difference between the ""Operational"" and ""Pre-Operational"" states is that the ""Operational"" state indicates full functionality and readiness, while the ""Pre-Operational"" state indicates a transitional phase where the participant is preparing to become operational."

## 4.4.3. Heartbeat

The heartbeat protocol serves one participant to inform all the participants within the network about its current opterating state. 

This service is implemented according to the *4.3.5.1 Producer - Consumer* **model.** 
The message needs to be activated explicitly and is sent on a cyclical basis. Via the object 
""*Producer* heartbeat time"" **the heartbeat can be activated and the repeat rate can be configured.** 
Should the heartbeat consumer report the absence of a heartbeat message, it will inform its superordinate application software about this event. The application should then react in the appropriate way. The message has a data length of one byte, which reports the current state of the participant. <chunk_seperator> <table_63>[{'Field': 'Content'}, {'---------': '-------------------------------------------', '-----------': '-------------------'}, {'name': 'Participant is in the ""Operational"" mode.'}, {'7Fh': 'Pre-Operational  Participant is in', 'the': '""Pre-operational""'}]</table_63>

 Question:  The NMT message has a data length of 2 bytes. The first byte (BYTE 0) specifies the command (e.g., Start node, Stop node, Enter Pre-Operational), and the second byte (BYTE 1) specifies the Node ID of the participant to be changed.","The NMT message, which has a data length of 2 bytes, plays a crucial role in the communication between the NMT Master and the network participants. The first byte, BYTE 0, carries significant information as it specifies the command to be executed by the participant. This command can be one of the following: Start node, Stop node, or Enter Pre-Operational. The command is represented by a specific hexadecimal value, such as 01h for Start node, 02h for Stop node, and 80h for Enter Pre-Operational.

On the other hand, the second byte, BYTE 1, is responsible for identifying the Node ID of the participant that needs to execute the specified command. This Node ID can be any value between 1 and 127, inclusive. If the Node ID is 0, it implies that the message is intended for all participants in the network.

To illustrate this, let's consider an example where the NMT Master sends a signal to all network participants to change to the ""Operational"" state. In this case, the NMT message would have BYTE 0 set to 01h, indicating the Start node command, and BYTE 1 set to 0, signifying that the message is intended for all participants.

In another scenario, if the NMT Master wants to send a signal to a specific participant with Node ID 1 to change to the ""Pre-Operational"" state, the NMT message would have BYTE 0 set to 80h, indicating the Enter Pre-Operational command, and BYTE 1 set to 1, specifying the Node ID of the participant.

In summary, the NMT message's 2-byte structure allows it to convey essential information about the command to be executed and the participant that needs to execute it, enabling efficient communication between the NMT Master and the network participants."

 Question:  The ""Operational"" state means the participant is in a normal operating mode, while the ""Pre-Operational"" state means the participant is in a preparatory mode, not yet fully operational.","The provided context describes the NMT (Network Management Technology) protocol, which is used for communication between devices in a network. The protocol consists of several message types, including NMT messages, Heartbeat messages, and others.

The NMT message has a data length of 2 bytes, where each byte has a specific meaning. The first byte (BYTE 0) contains a command, which can be one of the following: Start node (01h), Stop node (02h), Enter Pre-Operational (80h), or Reset node (81h). The second byte (BYTE 1) contains the Node ID, which can be either 0 (indicating that the message is being processed by all participants) or a value between 1-127 (indicating the Node ID of the participant to be changed).

For example, if the NMT Master sends a signal to all network participants to change to the ""Operational"" state, the NMT message would be ""Start all nodes"" with a CAN ID of 0 and BYTE 0 containing the command 01h.

The Heartbeat protocol is another service provided by the NMT protocol. It allows a participant to inform all other participants in the network about its current operating state. The Heartbeat message has a data length of one byte, which reports the current state of the participant. The message can be activated explicitly and is sent on a cyclical basis. If the Heartbeat consumer reports the absence of a Heartbeat message, it will inform its superordinate application software about this event, and the application should react accordingly.

For instance, if a device with Node ID = 1 is currently in the ""Pre-Operational"" mode, the Heartbeat signal would contain the status 7Fh.

The example provided in section 4.4.4 demonstrates the behavior of an NMT system. In this example, a participant with Node ID = 1 is connected to an NMT Master (CANopen manager) and is re-initialized at the beginning of the recording (power ON). After successful initialization, the device sends its ""boot-up"" message. After a defined time, the manager starts all participants, and the device starts sending its process data (TPDO1). After a further defined period, the manager sends an additional signal to change to ""Pre-Operational"", and the device terminates the sending of process data. The manager then writes into the object 5300 in the device (Node ID = 1), and the device confirms that the writing access has been successful. After another defined period, the manager sends an additional signal to change to ""Stopped"", and the manager again attempts to write into the object 5300 in the device, but the inquiry is not responded to by the device.

In this example, the participant is configured such that the ""Operational"" state means the participant is in a normal operating mode, while the ""Pre-Operational"" state means the participant is in a preparatory mode, not yet fully operational."

 Question:  When the heartbeat consumer reports the absence of a heartbeat message, it informs its superordinate application software about this event. The application should then react appropriately, e.g., by taking corrective action or alerting the operator.","When the heartbeat consumer reports the absence of a heartbeat message, it informs its superordinate application software about this event. The application should then react appropriately, e.g., by taking corrective action or alerting the operator.

In the context of the NMT protocol, the heartbeat message is a crucial component that ensures the network participants are operational and responsive. The heartbeat consumer, which is typically the NMT Master, monitors the heartbeat messages sent by the participants at regular intervals. If the heartbeat consumer fails to receive a heartbeat message from a participant within a specified timeframe, it assumes that the participant is no longer operational and reports this absence to its superordinate application software.

The application software, upon receiving this report, should react promptly to address the issue. This reaction may involve taking corrective action, such as attempting to re-initialise the participant or alerting the operator to investigate and resolve the problem. The goal is to ensure that the network remains operational and that any issues are quickly identified and resolved.

In the example provided, the participant with Node ID = 1 is connected to the NMT Master and undergoes a series of state transitions, including initialisation, boot-up, operational mode, pre-operational mode, and stopped mode. Throughout these transitions, the participant sends heartbeat messages to the NMT Master, which monitors these messages to ensure the participant's operational status.

If, at any point, the NMT Master fails to receive a heartbeat message from the participant, it will report this absence to the application software, which should then react appropriately to address the issue. This ensures that the network remains operational and that any issues are quickly identified and resolved.

 Question:  When the NMT Master sends a signal to change to ""Operational"" state, the participant responds by switching to the ""Operational"" state. This is exemplified in the example, where the NMT Master sends a ""Start all nodes"" signal, and the participant (Node ID = 1) responds by switching to the ""Operational"" state.","The given context describes the NMT (Network Management) protocol used in CAN (Controller Area Network) bus systems. The protocol enables communication between a master node and multiple participant nodes in a network. The NMT protocol is responsible for managing the state of the participant nodes, ensuring they are in the correct operational state.

The NMT message has a data length of 2 bytes, where each byte has a specific significance. The first byte (BYTE 0) contains the command, and the second byte (BYTE 1) contains the Node ID. The commands include ""Start node"" (01h), ""Stop node"" (02h), ""Enter Pre-Operational"" (80h), and ""Reset node"" (81h).

In the example provided, when the NMT Master sends a ""Start all nodes"" signal (CAN ID = 0, BYTE 0 = 01h, BYTE 1 = 0), all participant nodes, including the one with Node ID = 1, respond by switching to the ""Operational"" state.

The Heartbeat protocol is another service provided by the NMT protocol. It allows a participant node to inform all other nodes in the network about its current operational state. The Heartbeat message has a data length of 1 byte, which reports the current state of the participant. The Heartbeat protocol is implemented according to the Producer-Consumer model, where the producer (the participant node) sends Heartbeat messages on a cyclic basis, and the consumer (the NMT Master) monitors these messages. If the consumer detects the absence of a Heartbeat message, it will inform its superordinate application software, which should then react accordingly.

In the example, a Heartbeat signal from a device with Node ID = 1, currently in the ""Pre-Operational"" mode, is shown (CAN ID = Status, BYTE 0 = 7Fh).

The provided example demonstrates the NMT behavior in a CAN protocol. The participant node with Node ID = 1 is connected to an NMT Master (CANopen manager) and is re-initialized at the beginning of the recording (power ON). The device sends its ""boot-up"" message after successful initialization. After a defined time, the manager starts all participants by sending a ""Start all nodes"" signal. The device then starts sending its process data (TPDO1). After a further defined period, the manager sends an additional signal to change to ""Pre-Operational"" state, and the device terminates the sending of process data. The manager writes onto the object 5300 in the device (Node ID = 1), and the device confirms the writing access has been successful. After a further defined period, the manager sends an additional signal to change to ""Stopped"" state. The manager again attempts to write onto the object 5300 in the device (Node ID = 1), but the inquiry is not responded by the device.

In summary, the NMT protocol is used to manage the state of participant nodes in a CAN bus system. The protocol provides services like the Heartbeat protocol, which allows participant nodes to inform other nodes about their operational state. The example demonstrates the NMT behavior in a CAN protocol, showcasing the interaction between the NMT Master and a participant node."

- When the function IO_PWM_GetCur() **is called, the internal queue holding the values of**
the current measurement is flushed. If the function is called **more than once in a cycle**
it may or may not deliver new values, depending on how many values the equidistant current measurement has sampled since the last call.

- If there is no new current value available (for example the function **IO_PWM_GetCur()**
gets called more frequently than the PWM period) the flag fresh will be set to **FALSE**.

- If the functions IO_PWM_GetCurQueue() and IO_PWM_GetCur() **are called after each**
other, only the first function will deliver a current value because both functions will empty the internal measurement queue.

 Question:  What is the meaning of the Error Register value 11h in the EMCY-EC message, and what bits are set in this case?","The Error Register value 11h in the EMCY-EC message indicates that the ""Generic"" and ""Communication error"" bits are set.

To break it down, the Error Register is a part of the EMCY-EC message, which is a type of error message used in the CANopen protocol. The Error Register is an 8-bit field, and its value is 11h in this specific case.

According to the provided table_67, the Error Register field contains information about the error that occurred. The table shows that the Error Register is an unsigned 8-bit field, and its value can be interpreted as follows:

- BYTE 2: Error register (ErReg)

In this case, the value of the Error Register is 11h, which means that the ""Generic"" and ""Communication error"" bits are set. This is indicated by the fact that the Error Register value 11h is associated with the error message ""CAN in 'error passive'"" and the description ""Bit 'Generic' & 'Communication error' is set"".

In other words, when the Error Register value is 11h, it signifies that a communication error has occurred, and the device is in an ""error passive"" state. This error state is typically associated with a CAN bus communication problem."

 Question:  How are objects addressed in the Object Dictionary (OD), and what is the notation used for the object index and sub-index?","In the Object Dictionary (OD), objects are addressed via an object index, which is a unique identifier for each object. The notation used for the object index and sub-index is as follows:

* The object index is represented by a hexadecimal value, e.g., `1018.2`.
* The sub-index is represented by a decimal value, e.g., `0`, `1`, `2`, etc.
* When accessing a single object in the OD, the sub-index is always indicated additionally for addressing; see chapter 4.6.1.
* The notation for an object index and sub-index is `<index>.<subindex>, e.g., `1018.2.0`.

For example, `1018.2 → Identity object.Product code = 928037 s. *4.5.3 OD Example`.

In summary, objects in the OD are addressed using a unique object index, which is subdivided into sub-indices for further addressing. The notation for object index and sub-index is `<index>.<subindex>, where the index is a hexadecimal value and the sub-index is a decimal value."

- When the function IO_PWM_GetCur() **is called, the internal queue holding the values of**
the current measurement is flushed. If the function is called **more than once in a cycle**
it may or may not deliver new values, depending on how many values the equidistant current measurement has sampled since the last call.

- If there is no new current value available (for example the function **IO_PWM_GetCur()**
gets called more frequently than the PWM period) the flag fresh will be set to **FALSE**.

- If the functions IO_PWM_GetCurQueue() and IO_PWM_GetCur() **are called after each**
other, only the first function will deliver a current value because both functions will empty the internal measurement queue.

A specific value from this type of structure will therefore be addressed via the indication of the index and the sub-index. 

The notation of an object index will always be represented by hexadecimals, whereas the sub-index will be represented by **decimals.**
At first, the index of the main object will be indicated and divided by a ""."" the index of the relevant sub-object. Addressing a particular object will, thus, be represented as follows: <index>.<subindex> 
1018.2 → Identity object.Product code = 928037 s. *4.5.3 OD Example* When accessing a single object in the OD, the sub-index 0 always has to be indicated additionally for the addressing; see chapter *4.6.1 SDO*. 

1005.0 → COB-ID SYNC = 128 (80h) In one device, it is not required to have all the indices continuously and addressable. Gaps are usual in the OD. When accessing a non-defined object, the related error message will be issued.

## 4.5.4.1. Error Management (General Communication Objects)
 Question:  What is the purpose of assigning a particular activation value to an object, which is similar to a function call?","The purpose of assigning a particular activation value to an object, which is similar to a function call, is to enable the object to serve as a function. This means that when the object is called, the assigned function will be executed. In other words, the object will behave like a function, and the activation value will trigger the execution of the associated function.

This concept is explained in chapter 4.5.1.3, ""Objects Serving As Functions"", where it is stated that some objects are similar to function calls. When an object is assigned a particular activation value, it can be called like a function, and the writing process will consequently provoke the assigned function.

For example, the feature ""*Store parameters*"" needs to be activated for the permanent storage of object changes. This means that when the object is called with the assigned activation value, the function associated with ""*Store parameters*"" will be executed, and the object changes will be stored permanently.

In summary, assigning a particular activation value to an object that is similar to a function call enables the object to serve as a function, allowing it to be called and executed like a traditional function. This concept is essential in the context of process data transmission and object-oriented programming."

4.5.1.4. Object serving as process data content Some entries in the OD can be used for the transmission via a process value (PDO). The main advantage is that, doing this, the content of the object does not have to be requested explicitly via a SDO command any more, but is permanently available in the context of process data transmission. 

The object properties ""*mappable***"" defines that the content of the object can be transmitted** 
via a PDO; see chapters *4.6.2 PDO* and *4.6.2.3 PDO Mapping*. <chunk_seperator> The object properties ""*mappable***"" defines that the content of the object can be transmitted** 
via a PDO; see chapters *4.6.2 PDO* and *4.6.2.3 PDO Mapping*. 

In the different object tables, all the objects which are able to be transmitted as a process value, are marked in the ""PDO"" column as follows, i.e. object ""*Error register*"". 

TP Objekt can be mapped on a TPDO (T**ransmit).**

VFL VD and V1/4 measurement systems support the device profile ""CiA 404 Device profile for measuring devices and closed-loop controllers"". The process data transmitted during reset to default settings of the measurement system are described in chapter *3.1.1 CANopen default* **settings.** 
Certain objects have a generally applicable and device profile-specific section. Such objects 
(as for example the object *Error* **behavior) only describe the section which is defined via the** 
device profile. The definitions which are generally applicable are described in chapter 4.5.4 Communication profile area.

 Question:  What is the purpose of the Manufacturer status register?","The Manufacturer status register, with ID 1002h, is an expanded error state that contains device-specific error identifiers. The lowest 16 bits (bit 0-15) of this register contain the device-specific error identifiers, which are implemented in the error memory as additional information in case of an error. The higher bits (bit 16-31) can contain additional status information.

The Manufacturer status register is used in conjunction with the Error register (1001h) to provide more detailed information about the error that has occurred. When an EMCY message is sent, the lower 16 bits (bit 0-15) of the Manufacturer status register are transmitted in the manufacturer-specific part of the message.

The purpose of the Manufacturer status register is to provide a more detailed and device-specific error status, which can be used for error diagnosis and troubleshooting. It allows the device to report manufacturer-specific errors that are not covered by the standard error codes in the Error register.

In summary, the Manufacturer status register is used to provide additional error information that is specific to the device manufacturer, allowing for more detailed error diagnosis and troubleshooting."

 Question:  How is the transmission type defined for each available RPDO in the device?","The transmission type for each available RPDO (Process Data Object) in the device is defined by a specific structure for the definition of its individual transmission type. This structure is described in the section 4.6.2.5 Process flow sequence to change the ""PDO mapping"". 

Each available RPDO has its own structure, which corresponds to the description of the first object. The first ""RPDO communication parameter"" has the index 1400, the second one has the index 1401, and so on. 

The transmission type is defined by a parameter that specifies how the RPDO will be transmitted. This parameter is described in the table [table_75], which shows the transmission type options. 

The transmission type options are as follows: 
- 0: Acyclic synchronous 
- 1: Synchronous with each SYNC 
- 2: Synchronous with every 2nd SYNC 
- n: Synchronous with every nth SYNC 
- 254: Event-controlled manufacturer-specific event options 
- 255: Event-controlled device-specific event options 

For options 254 and 255, additional information can be found in chapters 4.6.2.1 Event driven and 3.6.3 device-specific PDO events. 

The standard default setting for the transmission type is 254, which means event-controlled manufacturer-specific event options. 

In summary, the transmission type for each available RPDO in the device is defined by a specific structure that specifies how the RPDO will be transmitted, with options ranging from acyclic synchronous to event-controlled manufacturer-specific event options."

 Question:  What is the purpose of the ""RPDO communication parameter"" with index 1400h in the device?","The ""RPDO communication parameter"" with index 1400h in the device is used to define the transmission type of a Receive Process Data Object (RPDO). This parameter determines how the RPDO will be transmitted from the device.

In particular, the transmission type can be set to one of the following options:

* 0: Acyclic synchronous
* 1: Synchronous with each SYNC
* 2: Synchronous with every 2nd SYNC
* n: Synchronous with every nth SYNC
* 254: Event-controlled manufacturer-specific event options
<|start_header_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* 255: Event-controlled device-specific event options

This parameter is part of the RPDO communication setup, which allows the device to send process data objects to other devices or systems. The RPDO communication parameter with index 1400h defines the transmission type of the first RPDO, and subsequent RPDOs have their own transmission types defined by their respective parameters.

In addition to the transmission type, the RPDO communication parameter also defines other settings, such as the COB-ID for the calculation of the operating CAN ID under which the RPDO will be accepted and received, and the minimum delay for the RPDO processing.

Overall, the purpose of the ""RPDO communication parameter"" with index 1400h is to configure the transmission of process data objects from the device, ensuring that the data is sent correctly and efficiently to its intended recipients."

Object index range: 1800h - 19FFh This range defines in which way a TPDO (i.e. process data sent by the device) will be transmitted. 

For a general description of the PDO transmission; please see chapter 4.6.2 PDO. 

To change the PDO mapping, a defined process has to be adhered to; see chapter <chunk_seperator> So the system designer must be careful with the cable harness **design to guarantee evenly distribution of supply current on all 4 pins. For example, it is not OK to use 1 cable with large diameter to** connect from a fuse box to the ECU for, let's say 2 meters and crimp it to 4 piggy tails with small diameter in the connector area. Small differences in the contact pressure can lead to a big imbalance.

In worst case condition 2 contacts carry almost the full current load and are overloaded at maximum current. It is better to use 4 wires with the same total cross sectional area than this one thick cable.

All wires must have exactly the same length and diameter. In this case an evenly distribution of current will be the case even with slightly different contact resistance.

Each available RPDO has its own structure for the definition of the process value parameter objects to be transmitted by this PDO. 

The ""RPDO mapping parameter"" object usually supports up to 8 + 1 different sub-entries. The first entry defines the amount of valid sub-entries, which means, the values to be transmitted subsequently (process value parameters).

When selecting the application software's glitch filter time, the system integrator should account for all those failures that may occur only temporary. For example, a low battery voltage situation caused by cold-start cranking may lead to an invalid sensor supply voltage. However, only violations that do last longer than the specified glitch filter time will signal a persistent error. For details, refer to section *Failure* Reaction in Case of *Errors.*

When selecting the application software's glitch filter time, the system integrator should account for all those failures that may occur only temporary. For example, a low battery voltage situation caused by cold-start cranking may lead to an invalid sensor supply voltage. However, only violations that do last longer than the specified glitch filter time will signal a persistent error. For details, refer to section *Failure* Reaction in Case of *Errors.*

Object index range: 1800h - 19FFh This range defines in which way a TPDO (i.e. process data sent by the device) will be transmitted. 

For a general description of the PDO transmission; please see chapter 4.6.2 PDO. 

To change the PDO mapping, a defined process has to be adhered to; see chapter <chunk_seperator> So the system designer must be careful with the cable harness **design to guarantee evenly distribution of supply current on all 4 pins. For example, it is not OK to use 1 cable with large diameter to** connect from a fuse box to the ECU for, let's say 2 meters and crimp it to 4 piggy tails with small diameter in the connector area. Small differences in the contact pressure can lead to a big imbalance.

In worst case condition 2 contacts carry almost the full current load and are overloaded at maximum current. It is better to use 4 wires with the same total cross sectional area than this one thick cable.

All wires must have exactly the same length and diameter. In this case an evenly distribution of current will be the case even with slightly different contact resistance.

 Question:  What is the transmission type defined by the parameter 1800h, and what is its data type?","The transmission type defined by the parameter 1800h is an unsigned 8-bit constant. This parameter defines the transmission type of a TPDO (TPDO communication parameter). The possible values and their corresponding meanings are listed in table_79. 

For instance, a value of 0 means that the transmission of the message is not synchronous with SYNC, whereas a value of 1 means that the transmission of the message is synchronous with SYNC. The values 254 and 255 are used for event-controlled manufacturer-specific event options and event-controlled device-specific event options, respectively. 

The standard default setting for this parameter is 254."

exactly specified in the CiA 301. The most common implementation used by HYDAC Filtertechnik GmbH is described below.
 Question:  What is the purpose of the ""TPDO mapping parameter"" object in the TPDO structure?","The ""TPDO mapping parameter"" object in the TPDO structure serves as a crucial component in defining the process value parameter objects to be transmitted by the TPDO. This object, identified as 1A00H **Record**, contains a specific structure that supports up to 8 different sub-entries. 

The first entry of this object determines the number of valid sub-entries, which in turn define the number of process value parameter objects to be transmitted in this TPDO. For instance, if the content of this object is set to 2, the first two of the subsequent sub-index objects must have a valid process value parameter object reference. 

It is essential to fill in the entries in a strictly sequential order, without leaving any gaps. If the object is set to 0 (1A00.0 = 0), the transmission of the TPDO is deactivated. 

Before making any changes to the PDO mapping, it is necessary to deactivate the PDO transmission, as described in chapter 4.6.2.5 Process flow sequence to change the PDO mapping. 

In essence, the ""TPDO mapping parameter"" object plays a vital role in configuring the process value parameter objects to be transmitted by the TPDO, ensuring that the correct number of valid sub-entries is defined and that the entries are filled in a sequential order without gaps."

This implies that two process value parameter objects will be transmitted in the TPDO. 

To elaborate, when the content of the ""TPDO mapping parameter"" object (1A00H 0) is set to 2, it defines how many of the subsequent sub-entries are valid, which in turn determines how many process value parameter objects will be transmitted in this TPDO. In this case, the first two sub-index objects must have a valid reference to a process value parameter object, and these two objects will be transmitted in the TPDO."

 Question:  What is the significance of the byte position in the ""Data block of the CAN message"" of the TPDO?","The significance of the byte position in the ""Data block of the CAN message"" of the TPDO is that it determines the starting point of the data transmission for the process value parameter object referenced by the TPDO mapping parameter object. 

In the context of the TPDO mapping parameter object, the byte position in the data block of the CAN message is crucial because it specifies where the data transmission for the referenced process value parameter object begins. This is important because the data length of the referenced process value parameter object varies depending on its data type, and the byte position ensures that the correct data is transmitted starting from the correct position in the CAN message data block.

For instance, in the example given, 1A00.1 = 60100010h, the byte position in the data block of the CAN message is byte 0, indicating that the data transmission for the referenced process value parameter object starts from the beginning of the data block. This ensures that the correct data is transmitted, and the receiving device can correctly interpret the data.

In summary, the byte position in the ""Data block of the CAN message"" of the TPDO is essential for ensuring that the correct data is transmitted and received correctly by the devices in the network, and it plays a critical role in the TPDO mapping parameter object's function of defining the process value parameter objects to be transmitted."

 Question:  What is the purpose of the ""Node Id"" object with index 2001H in the manufacturer-specific profile area?","The purpose of the ""Node Id"" object with index 2001H in the manufacturer-specific profile area is to manage the device address. This object is used to configure the device's Node ID, which is a unique identifier for each device in a CANopen network.

In the context of CANopen, the Node ID is used to address devices in the network, allowing them to communicate with each other. The Node ID is typically a 11-bit identifier, consisting of a 4-bit device type code and a 7-bit device address.

The ""Node Id"" object is used to set the device address of a device in the manufacturer-specific profile area. This object is usually supported by devices and is used to configure the device's address in the CANopen network.

In the provided description, the ""Node Id"" object is an array object that manages the device address. The standard setting of the device address is described in chapter 3.1"

The process values of the additional manufacturer-specific measurement channels can be transferred via a *TPDO*. 

However, this type of measurement channels will not be supported at all or at least not fully supported by each device, which means, the objects listed below may be only partly available or not at all.

 Question:  What type of measurement channels may be supported by some devices, as described in chapter 4.5.5.2 Additional Manufacturer-Specific Measurement Channels?","The provided text describes the object for device address management and baud rate management in the context of CANopen default settings. 

The device address management has two objects available: the active node-ID (2001h 1) which is the currently active device address and is read-only, and the pending node-ID (2001h 2) which is the desired change of device address. Changes to the pending node-ID will not take effect until they have been saved into the non-volatile memory and the device has been restarted or its power supply has been cut. 

The baud rate management also has two objects available: the active baudrate (2002h 1) which is the currently active baud rate and is read-only, and the pending baudrate (2002h 2) which is the desired change of baud rate. Changes to the pending baudrate will not take effect until they have been saved into the non-volatile memory and the device has been restarted or its power supply has been cut. 

Additionally, there is a checksum object (2010h) which contains the checksum of the current device software. 

Some devices, such as those from HYDAC Filtertechnik GmbH, may still support older implementations of the node ID object 2001h and baud rate object 2002h.

The term '*periodically*' or '*periodical*' within this documents refers for example to a frequently call of a function or a regular check of a state or variable. However, the 'periodically' condition is not related to certain time base, but to software cycles. Whenever something has to be done periodically, the said event shall be triggered at least *once per software cycle*.

## Safe State

In the *safe state* zero current is applied to the safety-critical outputs of the ECU, i.e. in case of an error all outputs will be switched off.

In the headline of the EDS, general information is given on the file itself and also for the device which is described by the file. The individual objects are listed in blocks and will alsways be launched by an object index. Each index has its individual description block. If the index has several different sub-entries (sub-index) these have their own description block automatically as well.

 Question:  What information is provided in the headline of the EDS file, and what is the purpose of the individual objects listed in blocks?","In the headline of the EDS file, general information is provided about the file itself and the device described by the file. This information includes the file name, vendor name, product number, and other relevant details.

The individual objects listed in blocks within the EDS file serve as a machine-readable description of the Object Dictionary (OD). Each object has its own multi-line entry for its description, and if an object has several sub-entries (sub-index), these have their own description block automatically as well. The purpose of these individual objects is to provide detailed information about the device-specific measurement channels, their physical units, data types, access types, and other properties.

For instance, the object 1001.0 ""*Error register""* provides information about the error register, such as its data type, access type, and default value. Similarly, the object 1018 ""*Identity object""* and its sub-entries (e.g., 1018sub0 and 1018sub1) provide details about the identity object, including its highest sub-index supported, vendor-ID, and other relevant properties.

In summary, the headline of the EDS file provides general information about the file and the device, while the individual objects listed in blocks provide detailed information about the device-specific measurement channels and their properties."

The term '*periodically*' or '*periodical*' within this documents refers for example to a frequently call of a function or a regular check of a state or variable. However, the 'periodically' condition is not related to certain time base, but to software cycles. Whenever something has to be done periodically, the said event shall be triggered at least *once per software cycle*.

## Safe State

In the *safe state* zero current is applied to the safety-critical outputs of the ECU, i.e. in case of an error all outputs will be switched off.

Safety-critical / Safety-relevant System The term *safety-critical* in the context of this document refers to a system whose failure or malfunction may result in death or injury. The HY-TTC 500 has been designed to fulfill ISO 13849 Category 2, Performance Level d and IEC 61508, Safety Integrity Level 2 requirements.

 Question:  What is PDO Mapping, and what is its purpose in the transmission of process data?","PDO Mapping is a system that refers to the configuration of Process Data Objects (PDOs) in a device. Its primary purpose is to manage the transmission and reception of process data between devices in a network. In other words, PDO Mapping determines how process data will be sent and received by a device.

The purpose of PDO Mapping is to ensure that process data is transmitted and received correctly between devices. Without a valid PDO Mapping configuration, no process data will be sent or received. This configuration defines how the process data will be transmitted, whether cyclically or synchronously, and which process data will be sent or received.

In essence, PDO Mapping acts as a bridge between the device and the network, enabling the exchange of process data between devices. It is a crucial component in the transmission of process data, as it ensures that devices can communicate effectively and efficiently.

In the context of CANopen, PDO Mapping is responsible for managing the transmission of process data between devices. It is a critical aspect of the PDO transfer protocol, which is based on the Producer-Consumer data model. The PDO Mapping configuration determines how process data will be sent and received, and it is essential for the proper functioning of the network.

In summary, PDO Mapping is a system that configures the transmission and reception of process data between devices in a network. Its purpose is to ensure that process data is exchanged correctly and efficiently between devices, enabling effective communication and coordination in the network."

 Question:  What is the PDO mapping process in OD work?","The PDO mapping process is a complex procedure in OD (Object Dictionary) work where several areas collaborate to achieve a specific goal. In this context, the PDO mapping process involves transmitting measurement signals from an inclinometer by HYDAC Filtertechnik GmbH via a TPDO (Transport Protocol Data Object). 

To illustrate this process, let's break it down into smaller components. The area ""*PDO communication parameter*"" defines when a PDO is supposed to be transmitted, and the area ""*PDO mapping parameter*"" determines which objects from the OD will copy or read that particular PDO message. 

The image [117_image_0.png] represents a black and white square with a prominently displayed ""I"" within the square, indicating the main focus of the scene. 

The table provided [table_92] outlines the PDO mapping process, showcasing the CAN-ID, byte allocation, index, name, access, and data type for each object. 

In essence, the PDO mapping process is a crucial aspect of OD work, as it enables the transmission of measurement signals from devices like inclinometers via TPDOs, facilitating efficient data exchange and processing within the system."

 Question:  What is the process to change the PDO mapping of a device?","The process to change the PDO (Process Data Object) mapping of a device involves several steps, which are outlined below:

**Step 1: Switch the device to ""Pre-Operational"" mode**

* Declare the PDO as invalid by setting bit 31 of the COB-ID to 1.
* Deactivate the number of object references used in the PDO by setting it to 0.

**Step 2: Set new object references in the ""PDO mapping parameter"" area**

* Memorize the number of new entries for the next step.

**Step 3: Set the number of object references used in the PDO to a new value**

* Set PDO back to valid by setting bit 31 of the COB-ID to 0 or the object = 0.

**Step 4: Save changes permanently on the device**

* See chapter 4.5.1.3 ""Objects serving as functions"".
* See object ""Save communication parameters"".

**Step 5: Switch the device to ""Operational"" mode**

* See chapter 4.4.1 ""Overview network conditions"".
* See chapter 4.4.2 NMT.

 Question:  What is the purpose of the LSS configuration mode?","The PDO mapping process is a complex procedure that involves multiple areas of the OD working together. In this particular case, the example shows how process data are ""mapped"" onto a TPDO. Specifically, the measurement signal ""static inclination"" from an inclinometer by HYDAC Filtertechnik GmbH is transmitted via TPDO1.

The area ""*PDO communication parameter"" defines when a PDO is supposed to be transmitted, and the area ""*PDO mapping parameter"" defines which objects from the OD will copy or read that particular PDO message.

The image [117_image_0.png] features a black and white square with an ""I"" written on it, which is prominently displayed within the square, making it the main focus of the scene.

To change the PDO mapping of a device, strict procedures must be followed. First, the device must be switched to ""pre-operational"" mode. Then, the PDO must be declared invalid by setting bit 31 of the COB ID to 1. Next, the number of object references used in the PDO must be deactivated by setting it to 0. After that, new object references can be set in the area ""PDO mapping parameter"". The number of new entries must be memorized for the next step. Then, the number of object references used in the PDO must be set to a new value. Finally the PDO must be set back to valid by setting bit 31 of the COB-ID to 0. Finally, the changes must be saved permanently on the device.

In the example of configuring the TPDO1 of a device, the COB-ID is set to 181h, the transmission type is set to event-controlled, the inhibit time is set to 0, and the event timer is set to 200 ms. The PDO mapping consists of three object references: 6010.0 INTEGER16, 6020.0 INTEGER16, and 5000.0 UNSIGNED8.

The LSS switch command serves for switching the active LSS condition. Only when the LSS configuration mode is active can the device be parameterized by means of other commands. This state may not be taken on by more than one device within the network at a time. The purpose of the LSS configuration mode is to allow the device to be parameterized by means of other commands."

 Question:  What is the purpose of the command ""activate bit timing"" in the context?","The purpose of the command ""activate bit timing"" is to enable all network participants to switch to a new Baud rate simultaneously, thereby avoiding communication errors.2019. This command is crucial in ensuring a smooth transition to the new Baud rate, as it allows all participants to terminate their ongoing message transmissions and reinitialize before sending messages using the new Baud rate.

The command ""activate bit timing"" serves as a synchronization mechanism, ensuring that all participants in the network switch to the new Baud rate at the same time. This is achieved by introducing a waiting delay, which is divided into two phases. The first phase, also known as the ""device reaction time,"" allows all participants to terminate their ongoing message transmissions. The second phase serves as a reinitialisation period, after which messages can be sent using the new Baud rate.

The waiting delay is chosen such that even the network participant with the longest reaction time has terminated its message transmission within the first phase. This ensures that all participants are synchronized and ready to switch to the new Baud rate, minimizing the risk of communication errors.

In summary, the command ""activate bit timing"" plays a vital role in enabling a seamless transition to a new Baud rate in a network, ensuring that all participants switch to the new rate simultaneously and avoiding potential communication errors."

 Question:  What is the significance of the 2 s delay defined by the LSS master in the example?","The 2 s delay defined by the LSS master in the example is significant because it serves as a waiting period for all network participants to switch to the new Baud rate. This delay is crucial in ensuring that all participants in the network terminate their message sending within the first phase of the delay, which is referred to as the ""device reaction time."" This allows for a smooth transition to the new Baud rate, preventing communication errors.

During this 2 s delay, all participants have to wait twice for the delay to expire before they can send their information using the new Baud rate. The first half of the delay serves for de-initialization of all participants, ensuring that they terminate their message sending within this time range. This is essential to avoid any conflicts or errors that might occur during the transition to the new Baud rate.

In essence, the 2 s delay defined by the LSS master is a synchronization mechanism that enables all network participants to switch to the new Baud rate simultaneously, ensuring a seamless and error-free communication process. This delay is a critical component of the ""enable bit timing"" procedure, which is a complex process that requires precise coordination among all network participants to activate a new Baud rate."

 Question:  What is the purpose of the ""store configuration"" command in the context?","In the context of the provided information, the purpose of the ""store configuration"" command is to enable the permanent storage of changes to the Node ID and the Baud rate on the device. This command is implemented according to the Request response model, which means that it follows a specific structure and format for requesting and responding to configuration changes.

In essence, the ""store configuration"" command serves as a confirmation step to ensure that the device has successfully updated its Node ID and Baud rate settings. This command is crucial in maintaining the consistency and accuracy of the device's configuration, ensuring that it operates correctly and efficiently.

It's worth noting that the ""store configuration"" command is distinct from the ""activate bit timing"" command, which is responsible for enabling a new Baud rate after a change has been made and stored. The ""store configuration"" command focuses on persistently storing the changes, whereas the ""activate bit timing"" command concentrates on implementing the new Baud rate in a coordinated manner among all network participants to prevent communication errors.

In summary, the ""store configuration"" command plays a vital role in the configuration process by ensuring that the device's settings are accurately and permanently stored, thereby guaranteeing the device's proper operation."

 Question:  What is the structure of the ""request"" and ""response"" messages in the ""LSS inquire command""?","In the ""LSS inquire command"", the structures of the ""request"" and ""response"" messages are different.

The ""request"" message structure is as follows:
- It starts with a Command Code (UNSIGNED8) in Byte 0, which specifies the type of inquiry.
- Bytes 1-7 are reserved.

On the other hand, the ""response"" message structure varies depending on the type of inquiry.

For the ""Inquire Identity Vendor-Id"" command, the ""response"" message structure is:
- It starts with a Command Code (UNSIGNED8) in Byte 0, which specifies the type of response.
- Bytes 1-4 contain the Vendor ID (UNSIGNED32), which is the manufacturer's code.
- Bytes 5-7 are reserved.

For the ""Inquire Identity Product-Code"" command, the ""response"" message structure is:
- It starts with a Command Code (UNSIGNED8) in Byte 0, which specifies the type of response.
- Bytes 1-4 contain the Product code (UNSIGNED32), which is the manufacturer-specific product code.
- Bytes 5-7 are reserved.

For the ""Inquire Identity Revision-Number"" command, the ""response"" message structure is not explicitly specified, but it is likely to follow a similar pattern, with the revision number being returned in Bytes 1-4.

In general, the ""response"" message structure may vary depending on the specific inquiry being made, but it typically includes a Command Code in Byte 0, followed by the requested information in the subsequent bytes."

 Question:  What is the significance of the ""LSS configuration"" mode, and what is the limitation of devices that can be in this mode at a time?","The ""LSS configuration"" mode is a specific operational state of devices in the LSS (Logical Switching System) framework. In this mode, devices are actively participating in the LSS network, responding to commands and inquiries from other devices or the central controller.

The significance of the ""LSS configuration"" mode lies in its ability to enable devices to communicate and exchange information with each other. This mode allows devices to respond to commands, such as storing recent changes permanently, inquiring individual sections of the LSS address, or inquiring the node ID of all devices currently in the LSS configuration mode.

The limitation of devices that can be in the ""LSS configuration"" mode at a time is that only one device should be in this mode at a time. This is to prevent potential conflicts or ambiguities in the responses received from multiple devices. If several devices are active at the same time, all of them will respond almost synchronously, but the order of the responses cannot be predefined. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that only one device is in the ""LSS configuration"" mode at a time to maintain a consistent and predictable communication flow within the LSS network.

In the context of the provided tables [table_103.png, table_104.png, table_105.png, table_106.png, table_107.png], the ""LSS configuration"" mode is crucial for devices to respond correctly to commands and inquiries, such as the ""store configuration"" command, the ""LSS inquire"" command, or the ""inquire identity"" commands."

If devices exist which correspond with the LSS address section which is pre-defined by the command sequence, these can respond with the ""*Identify slave***"" command.** 
Relationship between the command code and the LSS address section transmission. The individual request commands should be sent to the device in ascending order. <chunk_seperator> Content Meaning

 Question:  What is the purpose of the Identify Remote Slave command in the LSS protocol?","The purpose of the Identify Remote Slave command in the LSS protocol is to determine the number of devices with LSS protocol support that are currently connected to the CAN network. This command is used to identify remote slaves by sending a series of six consecutive messages, each containing parameters of the LSS address. The manufacturer and product code are firmly defined to limit the selection of devices, and a pre-defined value range is used for the revision and serial number. If devices exist that correspond to the pre-defined LSS address section, they can respond with the ""Identify slave"" command. The individual request commands should be sent to the device in ascending order, allowing the master (control) to identify the remote slaves connected to the CAN network."

 Question:  What is the purpose of the LSS Fastscan command, and in which chapter is it described?","The purpose of the LSS Fastscan command is not explicitly mentioned in the provided tables. However, based on the context of the LSS configuration and identification commands, it can be inferred that the LSS Fastscan command is likely used for quickly scanning or detecting devices on the network, possibly to identify their presence, configuration, or capabilities.

Although the exact purpose of the LSS Fastscan command is not specified, it is likely related to the LSS configuration and identification process, which involves switching a device to ""*LSS configuration***"" mode using a defined LSS address, and then using commands like ""*Identify slave*"" or ""*Identify non-configured remote slave*"" to retrieve information about the device.

The chapter where the LSS Fastscan command is described is not explicitly mentioned, but based on the context, it is likely described in a chapter related to LSS configuration and identification, possibly in a chapter like 4.7, which deals with LSS identification commands."

## 4.7.7. Example: Setting The Node Id And Baud Rate Via Lss <chunk_seperator> La mesure des valeurs Min/Max **revêt une** importance particulière et nécessite donc une explication détaillée. En plus des valeurs mesurées actuelles, l'HMG enregistre toujours les valeurs maximales et minimales (Valeurs Min/ Max), sauf lors de l'enregistrement d'une courbe de mesure. La valeur minimale est la plus petite valeur atteinte par une grandeur de mesure pendant un laps de temps donné, tandis que la valeur maximale est la plus grande valeur atteinte pendant le même temps. Lors de la réinitialisation, les valeurs Min/Max reprennent la valeur actuelle respective. Cette opération s'effectue systématiquement de manière commune pour tous les capteurs raccordés. Le laps de temps démarre systématiquement à la réinitialisation des valeurs Min/Max. Cette dernière est déclenchée par les situations suivantes : 
- **Mise en marche de l'appareil** 
- Sélection et activation de la fonction « **Reset** » 
dans la barre de menu 
(uniquement si « Min/Max **» est activé)** <chunk_seperator> The HMG 4000's ""measured values"" feature enables data ranges from a PDO to be visualised as a measured value. For this purpose, the channels ""CAN-Bus/HCSI (K)"" are available in the settings for the measured values. In below example, the process data ""signal static inclination"" and ""signal acceleration"" are shown from an inclination sensor by HYDAC Electronic GmbH. The settings required for the measurement of the ""signal static inclination (K1 slope long)"" is explained more in detail. 

![148_image_0.png]( The image displays a computer screen with two different sections showing various data and information. In one section, there is a graph displaying a line of numbers that appears to be related to weight or measurements. This part of the screen has a focus on the left side. <chunk_seperator> If a LSS device has been clearly identified, it will automatically switch to the ""*LSS configuration*"" state after the sequence has expired and confirm that the process has been successful by ""*Identify slave""***. The LSS device can now be condigured by the LSS master accordingly by means of the LSS features described above.**
Please see the CiA 305 for a more detailed description. <chunk_seperator> with matching address sections confirm the related request positively by sending the response ""*Identify slave""***. If the recently inquired address section does not match, no** 
response will be sent by the LSS device. In this case, the LSS master waits for a defined time, corrects the address section it has already received and requests the next address section. Therefore, up to 132 (4 * 32bit **+ 4) single requests are required in order to detect** 
the LSS address of a certain LSS device. <chunk_seperator> With the fastscan protocol, a LSS master can identify the *LSS address* **of unknown and nonconfigured devices. In the beginning of such a requests, all non-configured devices have to** 
be in the ""*LSS Waiting***"" mode.** 
The inquiry will be initiated by the LSS master by a particular request (""Bit Check"" = 128) in order to mark the start of the request sequence. This inquiry should be confirmed by all LSS 
devices which have not yet been configured by response ""*Identify slave***"". By means of this** 
response, the LSS master recognises that further LSS devices need to be configured. That is to say, the fastscan protocol performs a search for existing LSS addresses. For this purpose, all sections of the *LSS address* **are inquired bit by bit and sequentially. LSS devices** 
with matching address sections confirm the related request positively by sending the response ""*Identify slave""***. If the recently inquired address section does not match, no** <chunk_seperator> In the other section, there are several tables with rows of textual data, likely providing additional context or details about the subject matter. The tables occupy most of the right side of the screen. Overall, this image presents a combination of visual and text-based information to convey its message effectively.)

 Question:  What is the purpose of the fastscan protocol in the LSS master-slave communication?","The purpose of the fastscan protocol in LSS (Layer Setting Services) master-slave communication is to identify the LSS address of unknown and non-configured devices. This protocol performs a search for existing LSS addresses by inquiring all sections of the LSS address bit by bit and sequentially. 

When a request is initiated by the LSS master, all non-configured devices have to be in the ""LSS Waiting"" mode. The LSS master sends a particular request, known as ""Bit Check"" (128), to mark the start of the request sequence. This inquiry is confirmed by all LSS devices that have not yet been configured by responding with ""Identify slave"". 

The LSS master then recognises that further LSS devices need to be configured and continues the search process. The LSS devices with matching address sections confirm the related request positively by sending the response ""Identify slave"". If the recently inquired address section does not match, no response will be sent by the LSS device. 

Up to 132 single requests are required to detect the LSS address of a certain LSS device. Once a LSS device has been clearly identified, it will automatically switch to the ""LSS configuration"" state after the sequence has expired and confirm that the process has been successful by ""Identify slave"". The LSS device can then be configured by the LSS master accordingly."

 Question:  What is the requirement for the ""Baud rate"" setting in the CAN interface, and why is it important?","The requirement for the ""Baud rate"" setting in the CAN interface is that it has to correspond with the device being evaluated. This is crucial because the Baud rate determines the speed at which data is transmitted over the CAN bus. If the Baud rate setting in the HMG 4000 does not match the Baud rate of the device being evaluated, it can lead to communication errors, data loss, or even complete failure to receive or transmit data.

In other words, the Baud rate setting must be synchronized with the device's Baud rate to ensure proper communication and data exchange between the HMG 4000 and the device. This is particularly important when evaluating signals from CAN messages, as incorrect Baud rate settings can result in inaccurate or incomplete data.

For instance, if the device being evaluated has a Baud rate of 500 kbps, the HMG 4000's CAN interface must also be set to 500 kbps to ensure seamless communication. Failure to do so may lead to errors, data corruption, or even damage to the device or the HMG 4000.

Therefore, it is essential to configure the Baud rate setting correctly to guarantee reliable and accurate data transmission and reception over the CAN bus. This is especially critical in applications where precise data is crucial, such as in automotive or industrial control systems."

 Question:  When should the ""Internal terminating resistor"" be activated or deactivated in the HMG 4000 function?","The ""Internal terminating resistor"" in the HMG 4000 function should be activated when the measurement device is not connected to an existing CAN network, such as when a particular device is directly connected to the measurement device. This is to ensure proper signal termination and prevent signal reflections that could cause errors or damage to the system.

On the other hand, the ""Internal terminating resistor"" should be deactivated when the measurement device is connected to an existing, correctly terminated network. This is because the existing network already has its own terminating resistors, and activating the internal resistor could cause conflicts or signal degradation.

It's essential to configure the internal terminating resistor correctly, depending on the connection scenario, to ensure reliable and accurate communication over the CAN bus. This setting is crucial for the proper functioning of the HMG 4000 function, especially when working with CAN-Bus/HCSI (K) channels, as shown in [148_image_1.png] and [149_image_0.png]."

 Question:  What is the difference between ""Active silent monitoring, confirm messages"" and ""Passive monitoring"" in the HMG 4000 function, and when should each be used?","In the HMG 4000 function, ""Active silent monitoring, confirm messages"" and ""Passive monitoring"" are two distinct modes that serve different purposes in the context of CAN-Bus/HCSI (K) channel configuration.

""Active silent monitoring, confirm messages"" should be activated when the HMG 4000 is not connected to an existing CAN network, but rather directly connected to a specific device being evaluated. In this scenario, the HMG 4000 acts as a master device, and it needs to confirm the messages it receives from the connected device. This mode ensures that the HMG 4000 acknowledges the received messages, allowing the device to function correctly.

On the other hand, ""Passive monitoring"" should be used when the HMG 4000 is connected to an existing, correctly terminated CAN network. In this case, the HMG 4000 acts as a slave device, simply monitoring and displaying the messages that are already present on the network. The HMG 4000 does not interfere with the network communication, and it does not send any confirmation messages.

To summarize, the key difference between these two modes lies in the HMG 4000's role in the CAN network. When the HMG 4000 is connected to a standalone device, ""Active silent monitoring, confirm messages"" should be used to enable message confirmation. Conversely, when the HMG 4000 is connected to an existing CAN network, ""Passive monitoring"" should be used to allow the device to monitor and display network messages without interfering with the communication.

It is essential to choose the correct mode depending on the specific setup and connection scenario to ensure proper communication and data evaluation in the HMG 4000 function."

 Question:  What is the assistant","The assistant is a feature of the HMG 4000 ""Can Tools"" that provides a set of functionalities to support the user in configuring and managing the channel characteristics for the CANopen-PDO protocol. The assistant is a wizard-like feature that guides the user through a series of menus and sub-menus to define the channel characteristics, such as the measurement range, resolution, offset, COB ID, number type, bit position, and bit length.

The assistant is designed to help the user navigate the complex process of configuring the channel characteristics, ensuring that the correct settings are applied to ensure accurate and reliable data transmission. By providing a structured approach to defining the channel characteristics, the assistant simplifies the process and reduces the risk of errors or misconfigurations.

Through the assistant, the user can access various menus and sub-menus, such as the process data menu, TPDO mapping parameter menu, and PDO communication parameter menu, to define the channel characteristics. The assistant also provides access to relevant chapters in the product description, such as chapter 3.3 Process data and chapter 4.5.4.9 TPDO mapping parameter, to provide additional information and guidance.

Overall, the assistant is a valuable tool for users of the HMG 4000 ""Can Tools"" who need to configure and manage the channel characteristics for the CANopen-PDO protocol."

 Question:  What is the importance of selecting the correct Node ID before importing data using the wizard?","The importance of selecting the correct Node ID before importing data using the wizard lies in ensuring that the correct device is configured and recognised by the LSS Protocol. This protocol allows devices supporting LSS to be recognised and configured. If the incorrect Node ID is selected, the device may not be properly configured, leading to potential issues with data importation and communication. 

Additionally, selecting the correct Node ID prevents multiple devices from being connected at the same time, which is a crucial aspect as described in chapter 4.7.1 LSS Communication model. This is because only one device should be connected to the HMG 4000 at a time while this function is used. Via the function ""next"", a search for an LSS capable device is started, and its LSS address is read. The Baud rate and Node ID can subsequently be changed."

## 7.1. Ascii Table

Below is a list of the portrayable characters of the ASCII character set. By summing the horizontal and vertical identification code, the numeric value belonging to the particular character can be determined. The ASCII character encoding forms the basis of most of the character sets used for a standardised representation of the most important characters.

 Question:  What is the minimum cycle time required to create a periodically sent CAN message, such as a SYNC Master?","To create a periodically sent CAN message, such as a SYNC Master, a cycle time of greater than 0 milliseconds is required. This means that the message needs to be sent at a specific interval, which is defined by the cycle time. The cycle time determines how often the message is sent, and it must be set to a value greater than 0 milliseconds to ensure that the message is sent periodically.

In the context of CAN (Controller Area Network) communication, a SYNC Master is a device that sends a periodic message to synchronize other devices on the network. This periodic message is used to coordinate the actions of the other devices, ensuring that they operate in a synchronized manner.

To achieve this synchronization, the SYNC Master must send the message at a fixed interval, which is defined by the cycle time. The cycle time is a critical parameter in CAN communication, as it determines the frequency at which the message is sent. A cycle time of 0 milliseconds would mean that the message is sent only once, which is not suitable for a SYNC Master that needs to send periodic messages.

Therefore, to create a periodically sent CAN message, such as a SYNC Master, a cycle time greater than 0 milliseconds is required. This ensures that the message is sent at a fixed interval, allowing the other devices on the network to synchronize their actions accordingly."

 Question:  What is the significance of the ASCII table provided in the appendix, and how is it used to represent characters?","The ASCII table provided in the appendix is a character encoding standard that assigns a unique numerical value to each character in the character set. This table is significant because it forms the basis of most character sets used for standardized representation of characters in computers.

The ASCII table is used to represent characters by assigning a numerical value to each character. This numerical value is determined by summing the horizontal and vertical identification codes. For instance, the character 'A' as a capital letter has a numerical value of 65 (41h), which is calculated by adding the horizontal and vertical identification codes.

The ASCII table is divided into sections, each representing a range of characters. The sections include control characters, digits, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters. Each character in these sections has a unique numerical value, which is used to represent the character in computer systems.

The significance of the ASCII table lies in its ability to provide a standardized way of representing characters in computers. This standardization enables different computer systems and devices to communicate and exchange data efficiently, as they can all understand the same character representations.

In the context of the CAN message, the ASCII table is important because it provides a way to represent characters in a standardized format. This is necessary for periodically sent CAN messages, such as those used to simulate an SYNC Master, where a cycle time of greater than 0 ms has to be assigned to the message.

In summary, the ASCII table is a character encoding standard that assigns unique numerical values to characters, enabling standardized representation of characters in computers. Its significance lies in its ability to facilitate efficient communication and data exchange between different computer systems and devices, which is essential for periodically sent CAN messages."

## 7.1. Ascii Table

Below is a list of the portrayable characters of the ASCII character set. By summing the horizontal and vertical identification code, the numeric value belonging to the particular character can be determined. The ASCII character encoding forms the basis of most of the character sets used for a standardised representation of the most important characters. 

Particular language-specific special characters, such as the ß **which is part of the German** 
written language, cannot be displayed using ASCII encoding. For the representation of these characters, there are special international character sets which will not be referred to herein, as special characters are not supported by the devices.

VFL CANopen 161 7.1.2. ASCII table in hexadecimal representation
 Question:  What is the purpose of the hexadecimal representation of the ASCII table shown in the image ![160_image_0.png]?","The purpose of the hexadecimal representation of the ASCII table shown in the image ![160_image_0.png] is to provide a numerical representation of each character in the ASCII character set. This allows for easy identification and manipulation of individual characters within computer systems.

In the ASCII table, each character is assigned a unique numerical value, ranging from 0 to 127. This hexadecimal representation enables the representation of these values in a compact and human-readable format. For instance, the character 'A' is represented by the hexadecimal value 41h, while the character 'a' is represented by 61h.

This hexadecimal representation is essential in computer programming, as it facilitates the efficient storage and transmission of data. It also enables the development of algorithms and programs that can process and manipulate text data effectively.

In various applications, including text editors, compilers, and communication protocols.

Furthermore, the hexadecimal representation of the ASCII table is crucial in debugging and troubleshooting computer systems. By examining the hexadecimal values of characters, developers can identify and diagnose issues related to character encoding, data transmission, and storage.

In summary, the purpose of the hexadecimal representation of the ASCII table is to provide a compact, human-readable, and machine-efficient representation of characters, enabling efficient data processing, transmission, and storage in computer systems."
