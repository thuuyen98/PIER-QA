It will help you to get acquainted with the provided communication interface and assist you in obtaining maximum benefit in the possible applications for which it is designed.
Question:  What is the purpose of the LSS Protocol Support, and what features does it provide?","The purpose of the LSS (Layer Setting Services) Protocol Support is to provide a standardized way of configuring and managing the communication settings of devices in a CAN (Controller Area Network) bus system. 

The LSS Protocol Support provides features such as:

1. LSS Communication model: This defines how devices on the CAN bus communicate with each other to configure and manage communication settings.

2. LSS Switch commands: These are used to switch between different communication settings or modes.

3. LSS Identify commands: These are used to identify devices on the CAN bus and determine their communication settings.

4. Setting the node ID and Baud rate via LSS: This allows devices on the CAN bus to be configured and managed remotely.

The LSS Protocol Support is an essential component of the CANopen protocol, which is a higher-layer protocol that provides a standardized way of communicating between devices on a CAN bus. It provides a common interface for devices from different manufacturers, making it easier to integrate them into a single system.

In the context of the Virtual Fluid Lab (VFL), the LSS Protocol Support is used to configure and manage the communication settings of devices in the system, ensuring reliable and efficient communication between devices."

It will help you to get acquainted with the provided communication interface and assist you in obtaining maximum benefit in the possible applications for which it is designed.
Question:  What is the significance of the PDO Process values as measurements in the HMG 4000 section?","In the context of the Virtual Fluid Lab (VFL) documentation, the PDO Process values as measurements in the HMG 4000 section (referenced in table_4 as 5.1.2.) signify the representation of process values as measurements in the HMG 4000 product.

PDO (Process Data Object) is a concept in the VFL documentation that refers to the transmission of process data between devices in a control system. In this context, process values are the actual measurements or data that are being transmitted.

The significance of PDO Process values as measurements in the HMG 4000 section lies in the fact that it enables the HMG 4000 product to transmit and receive process data, such as sensor measurements or actuator values, in a standardized and efficient manner. This allows for seamless communication between devices in the control system, enabling real-time monitoring and control of the process.

In the HMG 4000 section, the PDO Process values as measurements are likely to be used for various applications, such as data acquisition, monitoring, and control. By representing process values as measurements, the HMG 4000 product can provide a standardized interface for accessing and manipulating process data, making it easier to integrate with other devices and systems in the control system.

Overall, the PDO Process values as measurements in the HMG 4000 section play a crucial role in enabling efficient and standardized communication of process data in the VFL system, which is essential for reliable and efficient operation of the control system."

![6_Image_1.Png](6_Image_1.Png)

This protocol description exclusively applies to the following measurement system series for differential and dynamic pressure measurement without increased demands upon functional safety. The products covered by this description can be identified by means of the following model code structure: 
 CANopen: **Vx VFL.0/-V-C4D020**
o **Only the positions in the model code marked by ""x"" can be freely occupied** 
using the attributes listed in the data sheet. 

The products are components of a system or machine, labelled with affixed nameplates. The following documentation should therefore always be read together: 
 **The operator's system and machine-specific operating manuals** 
 **The related instruction manual** 
 **This protocol description for CANopen** 

## 1.2. Exclusion Of Liability <chunk_seperator> Category: Comment ID: 1534875 The following table covers all those functional blocks for which the HY-TTC 520 ECU does not provide any diagnostic measures. However, the system integrator may implement measures against dangerous failures on system level. To that end, every block's overall failure rate is assumed to be evenly distributed between safe and dangerous failures according to the general approach in ISO 13849, i.e. MTTFd = 2 * 
MTTF. The diagnostic measures and the determination of their diagnostic coverage is in the responsibility of the system integrator. Therefore, no detailed guideline can be given here. <chunk_seperator> Remarks

However, the system integrator may implement measures against dangerous failures on system level. To that end, every block's overall failure rate is assumed to be evenly distributed between safe and dangerous failures according to the general approach in ISO 13849, i.e. MTTFd = 2 * 
MTTF. The diagnostic measures and the determination of their diagnostic coverage is in the responsibility of the system integrator. Therefore, no detailed guideline can be given here. <chunk_seperator> Remarks

## 2.1. General Communication Characteristics

In general, the measurement systems are the end-nodes within a communication network. They do not take control of their superordinate network themselves. However, these devices are able to generate and send information spontaneously. This means that the measurement systems mainly serve as a data source - they generate process data. 

The following types of information can be generated and processed by the measurement system: 
 *Process data* **current actual or nominal values**
 *Parameters* **System data for the device identification or configuration**
 *Events* **Information on particular events, such as errors** 
The information types listed here are explained in more detail in the following chapters. 

## 2.2. Display Of Numeric Figures <chunk_seperator> ## 2.3.1. Counting Principle For Bit And Byte Position In The Data Block

In practice, there are different ways of counting in order to define the positon of a particular date within a data block. For this documentation, the following way of counting has been defined: 
 Bit **positions within a continuous data block start with** 0. <chunk_seperator> ## 1.5.2. Notes On Using This Documentation Efficiently

This chapter *3.1 Quick* **guide is designed to lead you to responses to the most frequently** 
asked questions as quickly as possible. 

Symbols and abbreviations are explained in chapters 1.3 *Symbols* and 1.4 **Abbreviations**

## 1.6. Changes In Technical Terms In The Context Of ""Political Correctness"" <chunk_seperator> ## 1.6. Changes In Technical Terms In The Context Of ""Political Correctness""

HYDAC Filtertechnik GmbH continuously strives to respect human rights and every individual's dignity in any context. However, when it comes to communication technology, one technical term is still very common: ""Master - Slave"". In order to avoid this archaic and discriminating expression, the term has been replaced wherever possible in this documentation, using the following substitution: ""Master - Device"" (""Device"" replacing ""Slave""). The only exceptions are terms which are used in this form in official documentation. These exceptions are only used to make it easier for the reader to understand the connection between this documentation and the official documents. 

## 2. Fundamentals And Basics

The following sections will explain general, non-product specific information for a better understanding of the functioning principle of a measurement system with a communication interface. <chunk_seperator> ## 1.5.1. Chapter Structure

The general structure is divided into the following essential chapters. 

## 2 Fundamentals **And Basics**

General information explaining the function principle of a measuring system equipped with a communication interface. 

## 3 Product **Interface**

All the product specific characteristics are described here. Certain sections of this description may repeat and differ at the same time in the protocol description if the measurement system described herein deviates from the general protocol description or if the properties of the protocol description are complemented.

## 4 Protocol Description **Canopen**

The general protocol description provides you with all information required for a successful communication. It explains, for instance, how the process data is transmitted with this specific communication protocol. In addition, it explains how to change the measurement system configuration settings. <chunk_seperator> ## 2.2. Display Of Numeric Figures

The figures without additional markings are displayed as numeric figures with decimals 
(number basis 10). For a more simple display of data blocks, however, hexadecimal representation is also very commonly used (number basis 16). In our document, the hexadecimals are generally marked by an ""h"" as a suffix. 

Decimal numbers, when displayed in a mixed representation, are marked with the additional suffix ""d"". Binary numbers (number basis 2) are marked by suffix ""b"". 

## Note

 12h **12 hexadecimal → 18 decimal** 

 A2h **A2 hexadecimal → 162 decimal** 

 16d **16 decimal → 10 hexadecimal** 66 **66 decimal → 42 hexadecimal** 

 10b **10 binary → 2 decimal** <chunk_seperator> Several other components are also visible within the circuit, such as a sensor supply, an analog output, and several wires connecting these various parts together. The diagram provides a clear representation of the electronic system's structure and functioning.)

## Absolute Vs. Ratiometric Voltage Measurement:

Many sensor types are available in absolute or ratiometric measurement variant.

- Absolute**: The sensor output voltage is a fixed value and directly corresponds to a physical**
value. For example, 2.5 V corresponds to 1 bar. Any tolerance **in the reference voltage of the** sensor and the ECU generates additional measurement inaccuracy. <chunk_seperator> ## Note

 12h **12 hexadecimal → 18 decimal** 

 A2h **A2 hexadecimal → 162 decimal** 

 16d **16 decimal → 10 hexadecimal** 66 **66 decimal → 42 hexadecimal**

## 2.1. General Communication Characteristics

In general, the measurement systems are the end-nodes within a communication network. They do not take control of their superordinate network themselves. However, these devices are able to generate and send information spontaneously. This means that the measurement systems mainly serve as a data source - they generate process data. 

The following types of information can be generated and processed by the measurement system: 
 *Process data* **current actual or nominal values**
 *Parameters* **System data for the device identification or configuration**
 *Events* **Information on particular events, such as errors** 
The information types listed here are explained in more detail in the following chapters.

HYDAC Filtertechnik GmbH continuously strives to respect human rights and every individual's dignity in any context. However, when it comes to communication technology, one technical term is still very common: ""Master - Slave"". In order to avoid this archaic and discriminating expression, the term has been replaced wherever possible in this documentation, using the following substitution: ""Master - Device"" (""Device"" replacing ""Slave""). The only exceptions are terms which are used in this form in official documentation. These exceptions are only used to make it easier for the reader to understand the connection between this documentation and the official documents. 

## 2. Fundamentals And Basics

The following sections will explain general, non-product specific information for a better understanding of the functioning principle of a measurement system with a communication interface. <chunk_seperator> ## 1.5.1. Chapter Structure

The general structure is divided into the following essential chapters. 

## 2 Fundamentals **And Basics**

General information explaining the function principle of a measuring system equipped with a communication interface. 

## 3 Product **Interface**

All the product specific characteristics are described here. Certain sections of this description may repeat and differ at the same time in the protocol description if the measurement system described herein deviates from the general protocol description or if the properties of the protocol description are complemented.

## 4 Protocol Description **Canopen**

The general protocol description provides you with all information required for a successful communication. It explains, for instance, how the process data is transmitted with this specific communication protocol. In addition, it explains how to change the measurement system configuration settings. <chunk_seperator> ## 2.2. Display Of Numeric Figures

The figures without additional markings are displayed as numeric figures with decimals 
(number basis 10). For a more simple display of data blocks, however, hexadecimal representation is also very commonly used (number basis 16). In our document, the hexadecimals are generally marked by an ""h"" as a suffix. 

Decimal numbers, when displayed in a mixed representation, are marked with the additional suffix ""d"". Binary numbers (number basis 2) are marked by suffix ""b"". 

## Note

 12h **12 hexadecimal → 18 decimal** 

 A2h **A2 hexadecimal → 162 decimal** 

 16d **16 decimal → 10 hexadecimal** 66 **66 decimal → 42 hexadecimal**

There are multiple wires connecting different parts of the circuit, including a green box that is part of the system. <chunk_seperator> The following sections will explain general, non-product specific information for a better understanding of the functioning principle of a measurement system with a communication interface. 

## 2.1. General Communication Characteristics

In general, the measurement systems are the end-nodes within a communication network. They do not take control of their superordinate network themselves. However, these devices are able to generate and send information spontaneously. This means that the measurement systems mainly serve as a data source - they generate process data. 

The following types of information can be generated and processed by the measurement system: 
 *Process data* **current actual or nominal values**
 *Parameters* **System data for the device identification or configuration**
 *Events* **Information on particular events, such as errors** 
The information types listed here are explained in more detail in the following chapters. 

## 2.2. Display Of Numeric Figures <chunk_seperator> ## 2.3.1. Counting Principle For Bit And Byte Position In The Data Block

In practice, there are different ways of counting in order to define the positon of a particular date within a data block. For this documentation, the following way of counting has been defined: 
 Bit **positions within a continuous data block start with** 0. <chunk_seperator> ## 1.5.2. Notes On Using This Documentation Efficiently

This chapter *3.1 Quick* **guide is designed to lead you to responses to the most frequently** 
asked questions as quickly as possible. 

Symbols and abbreviations are explained in chapters 1.3 *Symbols* and 1.4 **Abbreviations** 
used and definitions.

The display of numeric figures is explained in chapter 2.2 *Display* **of numeric figures.**

## 1.6. Changes In Technical Terms In The Context Of ""Political Correctness"" <chunk_seperator> ## 1.6. Changes In Technical Terms In The Context Of ""Political Correctness""

HYDAC Filtertechnik GmbH continuously strives to respect human rights and every individual's dignity in any context. However, when it comes to communication technology, one technical term is still very common: ""Master - Slave"". In order to avoid this archaic and discriminating expression, the term has been replaced wherever possible in this documentation, using the following substitution: ""Master - Device"" (""Device"" replacing ""Slave""). The only exceptions are terms which are used in this form in official documentation. These exceptions are only used to make it easier for the reader to understand the connection between this documentation and the official documents. 

## 2. Fundamentals And Basics

The following sections will explain general, non-product specific information for a better understanding of the functioning principle of a measurement system with a communication interface. <chunk_seperator> ## 1.5.1. Chapter Structure

The general structure is divided into the following essential chapters. 

## 2 Fundamentals **And Basics**

General information explaining the function principle of a measuring system equipped with a communication interface. 

## 3 Product **Interface**

All the product specific characteristics are described here. Certain sections of this description may repeat and differ at the same time in the protocol description if the measurement system described herein deviates from the general protocol description or if the properties of the protocol description are complemented.

## 4 Protocol Description **Canopen**

The general protocol description provides you with all information required for a successful communication. It explains, for instance, how the process data is transmitted with this specific communication protocol. In addition, it explains how to change the measurement system configuration settings. <chunk_seperator> ## 2.2. Display Of Numeric Figures

The figures without additional markings are displayed as numeric figures with decimals 
(number basis 10). For a more simple display of data blocks, however, hexadecimal representation is also very commonly used (number basis 16). In our document, the hexadecimals are generally marked by an ""h"" as a suffix. 

Decimal numbers, when displayed in a mixed representation, are marked with the additional suffix ""d"". Binary numbers (number basis 2) are marked by suffix ""b"". 

## Note

 12h **12 hexadecimal → 18 decimal** 

 A2h **A2 hexadecimal → 162 decimal** 

 16d **16 decimal → 10 hexadecimal** 66 **66 decimal → 42 hexadecimal** 

 10b **10 binary → 2 decimal** <chunk_seperator> Several other components are also visible within the circuit, such as a sensor supply, an analog output, and several wires connecting these various parts together. The diagram provides a clear representation of the electronic system's structure and functioning.)

## Absolute Vs. Ratiometric Voltage Measurement:

Many sensor types are available in absolute or ratiometric measurement variant.

- Absolute**: The sensor output voltage is a fixed value and directly corresponds to a physical**
value. For example, 2.5 V corresponds to 1 bar. Any tolerance **in the reference voltage of the** sensor and the ECU generates additional measurement inaccuracy. <chunk_seperator> ## Note

 12h **12 hexadecimal → 18 decimal** 

 A2h **A2 hexadecimal → 162 decimal** 

 16d **16 decimal → 10 hexadecimal** 66 **66 decimal → 42 hexadecimal** 

 10b **10 binary → 2 decimal** 

In other documentations, i.e. EDS files, you will also frequently encounter the format 
""0**x1042"". Here, the prefix ""0x"" marks the subsequent number as a hexadecimal.** When describing the entries in the OD (see chapter *4.5 The Object* Dictionary). **The index** 
is always shown in hexadecimal notation, but without any particular markings. 

## 2.3. Bit Order

The measurement systems use the ""Little Endian"" format for the transmission of their numeric values. In this representation of numeric values, the lowest bit (LSB; ""least significant bit"") will be stored and added the lowest data block address.

Question:  What format does the measurement system use for the transmission of numeric values, and how are the bit positions counted within a data block?","The measurement system uses the ""Little Endian"" format for the transmission of their numeric values. In this representation of numeric values, the lowest bit (LSB; ""least significant bit"") will be stored and added to the lowest data block address.

In a RECORD, a maximum of 255 entries is allowed. The individual value entries are accessed via a sub-index. The first sub-index for a value entry is 1. If a sub-index is accessed which is of higher value than the content of the subindex 0 (number of valid RECORD entries), an error message will occur.

The comparison with a simple constant may fail when having a combination of indications.

Bit positions which are unused may take on fixed values (0/1), depending on internal application states, or shift between the states. For a reliable evaluation, these bit positions should therefore be ignored. 

## Example Of A Bitfield

These diagrams are labeled ""Example of a Bit Field."" The arrangement creates an organized presentation of the concept being explained.) <chunk_seperator> ## 4.13.2.1 Power Stage Pairing

If outputs shall be used in parallel, always combine two channels from the same double-channel power stage and use the digital output mode. See Section 4.13.1 on page 149 **for using the right** power stage outputs in parallel. Due to thermal limits, the resulting total load current of this output pair has to be de-rated by a factor of 0.85 (e.g. combining two 3 A outputs would result in a total **load current of 3 A x 2 x 0.85 = 5.1 A).** The application software has to make sure that both outputs are switched on at the same point in time, otherwise the over-current protection may trip.

For balanced current distribution through each of the pin pairs, the cable routing shall be symmetrical if pin-pairs or multiple pins shall be wired parallel to support higher load currents.

## 4.13.2.2 Mutual Exclusive Mode <chunk_seperator> A RECORD is a data type containing a variety of different entries/values. In some programming languages this data type is also referred to as a structure. In contrast to an *ARRAY*, 
in the case of a RECORD, the individual entries may consist of different data types. The value entries in a RECORD therefore have different meanings and contents, i.e. *Device* code**. For the individual entries, the simple data types described above, such as** UNSIGNED32**, are used.** <chunk_seperator> Each bit of the BITFIELD therefore corresponds with a signal of the data type *BOOLEAN*. 

The significance of each individual bit is explained in the related description. 

Status signals are often displayed as a bitfield. The representation of the content of a bitfield is usually in binary format, i.e. bit-oriented. The relevant characteristic is active if the bit which is related to the characteristic is active,

Question:  In a bitfield, what happens when a combination of indications is compared to a simple constant, and how can this be resolved?","In a bitfield, a combination of indications is compared to a simple constant, the comparison may fail. This is because a bitfield is a compact way of representing multiple boolean values as a single binary value, to conserve memory. Each bit in the bitfield corresponds to a specific signal or indication, and the binary value of the bit (0 or 1) determines whether the signal is active or inactive.

When a combination of indications is compared to a simple constant, the comparison is done by performing a bitwise operation (AND, OR, XOR, etc.) between the bitfield and the constant. However, this comparison may not yield the expected result because the constant may not have the same binary representation as the bitfield.

To resolve this issue, an appropriate masking should be applied to the bitfield. Masking involves applying a binary mask to the bitfield to isolate the specific bits that correspond to the indications being compared. The mask is a binary value that has bits set to 1 for the indications of interest and 0 for the others.

For example, if we want to check if indications A and B are both active in a bitfield, we can create a mask with bits set to 1 for A and B, and 0 for the others. Then, we perform a bitwise AND operation between the bitfield and the mask. If the result is equal to the mask, it means that both A and B are active.

By applying the appropriate masking, we can accurately compare a combination of indications in a bitfield to a simple constant, and resolve the issue of failed comparisons."

## 3.1. Quick Guide

This chapter is designed to give the user quick answers to frequently occurring questions. <chunk_seperator> Le HMG4000 prend en charge les contrôleurs à partir de la version du protocole 0.3.0. 

Cela nécessite un *""fichier MPF""* (MATCH Project File) créé dans *""MATCH""*. Sur la base du conteneur MPF ""**.mpf*"", un fichier de projet binaire ""**.hempf***"" est créé.** 
Celui-ci doit être copié dans le HMG dans le répertoire ""*Match / Mpf / ...***"", par exemple** 
""*Match / Mpf /General*"". 

Le HMG utilise le niveau d'accès utilisé dans le fichier de projet binaire. 

Actuellement, le DEV (1) y est toujours stocké. 

Dans le HMG, le niveau de débogage des différents contrôleurs n'est réglé que lorsque cela est nécessaire et uniquement pour chaque contrôleur séparément. Après l'ouverture d'un fichier de projet, les niveaux de débogage de tous les contrôleurs sont désactivés par défaut pour éviter une charge de bus inutile.

The exact measurement system-specific implementation of the device profile is described in chapter *3.5.3 Device profile-specific* parameters.

CAN-Trace example change device address The following example refers to a measurement system with an active device address 1 which is supposed to be changed to 10h (16d). <chunk_seperator> The I/O Driver uses internal data that is necessary for its correct function. The RAM memory where this data is located should be among the protected memory areas when unsafe code runs, however this interferes with the intended functionality of the I/O Driver. The I/O Driver uses several interrupts that can occur during the execution of the unsafe code and that require access to the I/O Driver data, which cannot work with the memory protection in place. **For this reason, the I/O Driver can be**
configured to deactivate the User MPU regions for the execution of its internal interrupt code. The regions are restored when the interrupt returns so that it has no impact on the user application. The I/O Driver offers three different configurations, called MPU protection policies:
- IO_MPU_POLICY_REGION0: The I/O Driver deactivates User MPU region 0 (IO_MPU_REGION_0) for its internal tasks. This is the legacy setting that allows using **IO_MPU_REGION_** <chunk_seperator> ## 2.4.8. String

A STRING is a particular data type used to visualise texts. A STRING consists of a variety of individual characters which generally represent one letter. In the memory, however, the individual characters are represented by a numeric value. In the protocol described here, the STRING is represented by the data type VISIBLE_STRING. The code, i.e. the relation between the letters and the numeric values in the memory, will be described in chapter 7.1 ASCII Table. <chunk_seperator> 3.1.3.1. Changing the device address (node ID)

Notice: If the temperature range is changed during the reference cycle, NO reset needs to be performed, as HYDACLAB automatically adapts to the new range. 

## 5.4.1.3 Output Scaling

In the output scaling menu you can set the upper range of operating hours, the HYDACLAB sensor thus counts the operating hours. 

The output signal for the operating hours is scaled to a value set by the user, i.e. 4mA 0 operating hours and 20 mA 10000 operating hours. This figure defines the maximum expected operating hours of the system since its last reset. Upper range Arrhenius: The Arrhenius rate defines the operating hours depending on temperature, the weighting is based on the Arrhenius equation.

The RAM memory where this data is located should be among the protected memory areas when unsafe code runs, however this interferes with the intended functionality of the I/O Driver. The I/O Driver uses several interrupts that can occur during the execution of the unsafe code and that require access to the I/O Driver data, which cannot work with the memory protection in place. **For this reason, the I/O Driver can be**
configured to deactivate the User MPU regions for the execution of its internal interrupt code. The regions are restored when the interrupt returns so that it has no impact on the user application. The I/O Driver offers three different configurations, called MPU protection policies:

Question:  What is the transmission type of the device?","The transmission type of the device can be determined by referring to the TPDO communication parameter table, specifically the row with Index '1800h' and Sub-index '2'. According to this table, the transmission type is represented by the value '254' and has a data type of 'VAR rw'. 

To answer the question, we need to examine the device profile and the specific implementation of the device profile in the measurement system. Based on the information provided in chapter 3.1.2 Device Profile, the device profile ""**CiA 404 Device profile for measuring devices and closed-loop controllers**"" is supported by VFL VD and VFL V1/4 systems. 

Furthermore, the exact measurement system-specific implementation of the device profile is described in chapter 3.5.3 Device profile-specific parameters. 

To determine the transmission type, we need to consult the device profile-specific parameters and the TPDO communication parameter table. Based on the provided information, the transmission type of the device is likely to be related to the TPDO2 transmission type, which is represented by the value '254' and has a data type of 'VAR rw'."

In the following, the meaning of the identifiers of a BITFIELD are described. 

## 3.3.6. Input Signal ""External Temperature Value""

This measurement system provides additional signals in the form of input signals in addition to its nominal measured variable ""Operating data"". 

A signal ""External fluid temperature"" is used as RPDO1 to optimise the signal ""Rest lifetime"". <chunk_seperator> <table_26>[{'Signal description': '3.2.2 ""Pressure value"" pressure""Pressure value"" pressure'}, {'------------------------': '------------------------------------------------------------'}, {'Signal properties': 'Value'}, {'Measurement range min.': '0'}, {'Measurement range max.': 'e.g. 600'}, {'e.g. 5000': '600)  [psi] depending on the design (0 ..  5000)'}]</table_26>

## 3.3.5. Status ""Pressure Value""

The status of the signal ""Pressure"" gives information on the validity of this signal. The status <chunk_seperator> <table_25>[{'Signal properties': 'Value'}, {'------------------------': '-----------', '----------------------------------': '-----'}, {'Measurement range min.': '-', 'BITFIELD;': 'Bit'}, {'Measurement range max.': '-'}, {'Resolution': '-'}, {'Offset': '-'}, {'Data type': 'UNSIGNED8'}, {'Data length': '8'}, {'Mappable': 'TPDO'}, {'Process value index': '3611.0'}, {'Default settings': 'TPDO1'}]</table_25>
# 3.3.3.1. Design Of Bitfield ""Vfl Status""

![31_image_0.png](16 different sets of numbers are displayed on this page, each set consisting of six numbers arranged in a row. The numbers are organized in a way that makes it easy to identify and compare them. This presentation could be used for various purposes, such as teaching or learning about numbers, comparing the distribution of numbers, or even analyzing data sets.)
Question:  What is the format of the BITFIELD status ""Pressure"" diagram, and what do the different sections of the diagram represent?","The format of the BITFIELD status ""Pressure"" diagram is a bit field consisting of six bits. The different sections of the diagram represent different statuses of the ""Pressure"" signal. 

The left section of the diagram, consisting of four boxes, represents the signal's validity. The numbers in the boxes, ranging from 1 to 4, likely indicate different levels of validity. 

The right section of the diagram, comprising five boxes, represents the signal's quality. The first box, labeled ""Positive Overload"", indicates that the signal is valid and has a high quality. The second box, labeled ""Not Valid"", suggests that the signal is invalid or unreliable. The third box is connected to the second box, implying a relationship between the two statuses. The last box on the right side, labeled ""Negative Overload"", likely indicates a low quality or invalid signal."

Question:  What is the function of the ""Error behavior"" object with index 1029h in the device profile?","The ""Error behavior"" object with index 1029h in the device profile is responsible for describing the error behavior in case of an internal device error or communication error. This object provides general information about error management, specifically for analogue input errors.

In the context of the device profile ""CiA 404 Device profile for measuring devices and closed-loop controllers"", the ""Error behavior"" object is used to define how the device responds to errors, such as communication errors or manufacturer-specific errors. The object contains information about the error status, which is also part of the EMCY message (see chapter 4.4. 5).

The ""Error behavior"" object is composed of several bits, each representing a specific type of error. For instance, Bit 0 represents a generic error, Bit 4 represents a communication error, and Bit 7 represents a manufacturer-specific error. As soon as a communication error or manufacturer-specific error occurs, the generic error is set.

In addition to describing the error behavior, the object also provides information about the error status, which is used to determine the course of action in case of an error. The object is part of the device profile, which means it is specific to the device type and is used to customize the device's behavior in case of errors.

In summary, the ""Error behavior"" object with index 1029h in the device profile is responsible for defining the device's error behavior and providing information about error management, specifically for analogue input errors."

Question:  What is the impact of the sampling rate on the filter constant and trigger handling in the AI Adc Sample Rate object with index 6114H?","The sampling rate in the AI Adc Sample Rate object with index 6114H has an impact on the filter constant and trigger handling. The sampling rate determines the interval at which a new measured value is processed. This means that the frequency at which the analogue input is sampled affects how quickly the filter responds to changes in the input signal and how often the trigger is activated.

A higher sampling rate (i.e., a shorter interval between samples) allows the filter to respond more quickly to changes in the input signal, which can be beneficial in applications where rapid changes in the signal need to be detected. However, it also increases the computational load and can lead to more noise in the filtered signal.

On the other hand, a lower sampling rate (i.e., a longer interval between samples) can reduce the computational load and noise in the filtered signal but may lead to a slower response to changes in the input signal.

The trigger handling is also affected by the sampling rate. A higher sampling rate can lead to more frequent triggering, which can be beneficial in applications where rapid responses to changes in the signal are required. However, it also increases the risk of false triggering due to noise in the signal.

In summary, the sampling rate in the AI Adc Sample Rate object with index 6114H has a significant impact on the filter constant and trigger handling, and its value should be carefully chosen based on the specific requirements of the application."

Question:  What is the meaning of the identifiers of a BITFIELD, and how are they used in the context of the ""Device Temperature"" status?","In the context of the ""Device Temperature"" status, the identifiers of a BITFIELD are used to provide information on the validity of the signal. The BITFIELD status is structured as a bit field, which means it consists of a series of bits that can have a value of either 0 or 1.

According to the provided information, the meaning of the identifiers of a BITFIELD is as follows:

* Bit 0: Set if the value is not valid due to an error in the measured value detection.

In the context of the ""Device Temperature"" status, the BITFIELD is used to indicate whether the measured temperature value is valid or not. If Bit 0 is set, it means that the value is not valid, and there is an error in the measured value detection. This information is crucial in determining the reliability of the temperature measurement.

The BITFIELD status is used in combination with the ""Device Temperature"" process value signal to provide a comprehensive understanding of the temperature measurement. By evaluating the BITFIELD status, users can determine whether the measured temperature value is trustworthy or if there is an issue with the measurement.

In summary, the identifiers of a BITFIELD in the context of the ""Device Temperature"" status are used to provide information on the validity of the temperature measurement, with Bit 0 indicating whether the value is valid or not due to an error in the measured value detection."

Question:  What is the purpose of the heartbeat protocol, and how is it supported by the measurement system?","The purpose of the heartbeat protocol is to provide a mechanism for the measurement system to detect and recover from errors or faults in the device or communication network. The heartbeat protocol is a way for the device to periodically send a signal to the measurement system, to indicate that it is still operational and functioning correctly. This allows the measurement system to detect if the device has failed or is no longer responding, and to take corrective action if necessary.

The measurement system supports the heartbeat protocol, as described in chapter 4.4.3. This means that the measurement system is designed to work with devices that implement the heartbeat protocol, and can detect and respond to heartbeat signals sent by the device. The purpose of the heartbeat protocol is to provide a way for the device to periodically check-in with the measurement system, and for the measurement system to detect if the device is no longer operational.

In the context of the provided flowchart, the heartbeat protocol is likely related to the ""Transmission"" section, which is highlighted in orange. This section may be responsible for handling the communication between the device and the measurement system, including the transmission of heartbeat signals.

The flowchart also features other sections, such as ""Process"", ""Calibration"", ""Filter"", ""Parallel"", ""Procedure"", ""Can"", and ""Message"", each with its own corresponding color. These sections may be involved in the overall process of measuring and processing data, but are not directly related to the heartbeat protocol.

The tables provided, such as [table_48], [table_49], [table_50], [table_51], [table_52], and [table_53], contain information about specific signals, measurement ranges, and data types. They do not appear to be directly related to the heartbeat protocol, but may be relevant to the overall operation of the measurement system.

The images, [52_image_0.png] and [52_image_1.png], do not appear to be directly related to the heartbeat protocol or the measurement system. The first image appears to be a visual aid for understanding number sequences, while the second image is a photograph of an outdoor scene.

In summary, the purpose of the heartbeat protocol is to provide a mechanism for the measurement system to detect and recover from errors or faults in the device or communication network. The measurement system supports the heartbeat protocol, which is likely related to the ""Transmission"" section of the flowchart."

The status of the ""Device temperature"" gives information on the validity of this signal. The status is structured as a bit field.
Question:  What are device profile-specific results, and how are they activated in the context of PDO events?","In the context of PDO events, device profile-specific results refer to the specific outcomes or values that a device can produce or report, which are defined by the device profile. These results are only active when an active ""Transmission type"" of 255 is set.

To activate device profile-specific results, the following conditions must be met:

1. The device must support the device profile-specific results, as defined in CiA 404.
2. The ""Transmission type"" must be set to 255, indicating that the device is configured to transmit profile-specific results.

Once these conditions are met, the device will report the device profile-specific results, which can be used to monitor or control the device's behavior. These results are typically used in conjunction with PDO events, which are used to communicate data between devices in a network.

In the provided context, the device profile-specific results are related to the AI interrupt delta input PV, with indices x133h, x134h, x135h, and x136h. This suggests that the device is capable of reporting specific values or outcomes related to the AI interrupt delta input, which can be used to monitor or control the device's behavior.

It is worth noting that the device profile-specific results are only active when the ""Transmission type"" is set to 255, indicating that the device is configured to transmit profile-specific results. This suggests that the device can be configured to report different types of results, depending on the transmission type setting."

## 8.4.5 Suiveur
Question:  What are the two types of errors that can occur in the measurement system system, and how are they handled?","According to the provided information, there are two types of errors that can occur in the measurement system: process data errors and general device errors.

Process data errors occur during the processing of process data, and when they occur, a corresponding error marker is set in the associated status. This status can be evaluated together with the process values. For example, the VFL status (see chapter 3.3.3 ""VFL status"") can be evaluated together with the process values.

General device errors, on the other hand, are related to the device configuration and can be provided as parameters (objects in the OD) and can be read out at any time (see chapter 4.6.1 SDO). These errors can be handled by the measurement system, which can change its operating status depending on the error behavior. For instance, the measurement system can take on an error behavior via the parameter ""Error behavior"" (see chapter 4.4 Network Management).

In terms of error management, the measurement system provides error objects that can be read out, such as the error register (see chapter 3.7.4 Error Events). These error objects can be used to detect and handle errors in the system. Additionally, error events can be sent as particular error messages (see chapter 3.6.1 Error messages and 4.4.5 EMCY).

In summary, the two types of errors that can occur in the measurement system are process data errors and general device errors. Process data errors are handled by setting an error marker in the associated status, while general device errors are handled by the measurement system, which can change its operating status depending on the error behavior."

Question:  How does the measurement system react to an error, and what are the different types of error behaviour?","The measurement system reacts to an error in different ways depending on the error type and device configuration. For process data errors, a corresponding error marker is set in the associated status. For example, if there is an error in the pressure value, the status signal ""VFL status"" will be set, and the measurement system will change its operating status accordingly.

In the case of general device errors, such as communication or configuration errors, it is possible to configure which operation mode the measurement system should take in case an error occurs via the parameter ""Error behavior"". This allows for customization of the error behavior depending on the specific device configuration and requirements.

There are different types of error behavior, including:

1. Process data errors: These errors occur during processing of the process data and are provided as status signals. Examples include errors in the pressure value or operating data.

2. General device errors: These errors include communication or configuration errors and can be configured to trigger specific operation modes in case of an error.

The measurement system provides general error objects, including the error register, manufacturer status register, and error memory, which can be used to manage and respond to errors. Additionally, specific error events can be sent as PDO events, allowing for real-time notification and response to errors.

In summary, the measurement system reacts to errors by setting error markers, changing operating status, and providing error objects and events that can be used to manage and respond to errors. The error behavior can be customized depending on the device configuration and requirements."

## 1.5 Hy-Ttc 500 Variants

The following HY-TTC 500 variants are described in this System Manual:
- **HY-TTC 580**
- **HY-TTC 540**
- **HY-TTC 520 (customer-specific variant only)** - **HY-TTC 510**
- **HY-TTC 590E**
- **HY-TTC 590**

## - **Hy-Ttc 508** <chunk_seperator> ## 4.2. Hardware Properties

CAN is a Bus system. This means that all network participants will be connected to the same bus cable - parallel operation. On the contrary, the Ethernet, which is usually used in office communication, only connects one participant with one other at one time. For the connection between several participants, additional hardware, i.e. a switch, is necessary. This effort is not **necessary using CAN. How the network has to be organised is described in the following** chapter 4.2.3 *Topology*. 

CAN mainly has 2 signal lines: CAN-H and CAN-L. Data transmission is performed via these two lines, see chapter 4.2.2 *Signal* **level.** 
Each network participant is equal **in a CAN network, which means that each of the participants is able and allowed to send messages. If a participant sends, all the others receive** 
the message and decide on their own if it is relevant for them or not. <chunk_seperator> <table_172>[{'Parameters': 'timer_channel'}, {'--------------': '---------------------'}, {'out': 'frequency'}, {'out': 'pulse_width'}, {'out': 'pulse_samples'}, {'out': 'edge_count'}, {'out': 'inc_count'}, {'out': 'primary_pin_value'}, {'out': 'secondary_pin_value'}]</table_172>

![57_image_0.png]( The image features a black and white letter I on a blue background. It appears to be an icon or symbol rather than text. The letter is large and occupies most of the space within the frame, making it the focal point of the image.) can be found in the operation manual. 

The following description makes no claim **to be complete, its only aim is** <chunk_seperator> As one participant, which is sending, will directly read back each written bit, it can also recognise its own message has been overwritten, and will immediately discontinue further data transmission. The participant who has interrupted transmission, will try to reinitialise its transmission after the higher prioritised message has been sent. In doing this, no messages will be lost. 

## 4.2.1. Wire Connections

CAN does not require any complicated wire connections. For the connection of the network participants one drilled pair of wires should be used. The pair of wires serves for the transmission of the signals CAN-H and CAN-L. Non-drilled cables should be avoided. The recommended core diameter depends on the length and has an average between 0.34 and 0.6 mm2. 

Almost all CAN connections provide an additional CAN_GND und CAN_SHLD. CAN_GND

CAN is a Bus system. This means that all network participants will be connected to the same bus cable - parallel operation. On the contrary, the Ethernet, which is usually used in office communication, only connects one participant with one other at one time. For the connection between several participants, additional hardware, i.e. a switch, is necessary. This effort is not **necessary using CAN. How the network has to be organised is described in the following** chapter 4.2.3 *Topology*. 

CAN mainly has 2 signal lines: CAN-H and CAN-L. Data transmission is performed via these two lines, see chapter 4.2.2 *Signal* **level.** 
Each network participant is equal **in a CAN network, which means that each of the participants is able and allowed to send messages. If a participant sends, all the others receive** 
the message and decide on their own if it is relevant for them or not. <chunk_seperator> <table_172>[{'Parameters': 'timer_channel'}, {'--------------': '---------------------'}, {'out': 'frequency'}, {'out': 'pulse_width'}, {'out': 'pulse_samples'}, {'out': 'edge_count'}, {'out': 'inc_count'}, {'out': 'primary_pin_value'}, {'out': 'secondary_pin_value'}]</table_172>

Question:  What is the purpose of prioritising messages in a CAN network?",The purpose of prioritising messages in a CAN network is to ensure that critical messages are delivered in a timely manner. This prioritisation mechanism allows the network to manage the flow of messages effectively. It ensures that high-priority messages are delivered first and then the lower prioritised messages are delivered afterwards. This prioritisation mechanism is used to prevent network congestion and ensure that all messages are delivered in a timely manner.

Signal Level

For the transmission, a symmetric voltage signal is used. This signal type has no direct reference with a signal mass, but only the voltage difference between both signal lines will be evaluated. This type of signal transmission has significant benefits in the case of interfering signals, as these will affect both signal lines equally and will be excluded at the subtraction. 

In the event of a dominant signal the signal line CAN-H will move to a higher voltage level and the CAN-L signal line will move to a lower voltage level.

Question:  What happens to the signal lines CAN-H and CAN-L in the event of a dominant signal?","In the event of a dominant signal, the signal line CAN-H will move to a higher voltage level, and the CAN-L signal line will move to a lower voltage level. This is explained in section 4.2.2, where it is stated that in the event of a dominant signal, the signal line CAN-H will move to a higher voltage level and the CAN-L signal line will move to a lower voltage level. This results in a difference voltage of approximately 2V between the two signal lines."

Signal Level

For the transmission, a symmetric voltage signal is used. This signal type has no direct reference with a signal mass, but only the voltage difference between both signal lines will be evaluated. This type of signal transmission has significant benefits in the case of interfering signals, as these will affect both signal lines equally and will be excluded at the subtraction. 

In the event of a dominant signal the signal line CAN-H will move to a higher voltage level and the CAN-L signal line will move to a lower voltage level. 

4.2.2.1. Diagram signal level CAN-high-speed 

![58_image_1.png]( The image depicts a graph with two lines on it, one blue and one red. The blue line is labeled ""CAN"" while the red line is labeled ""NH."" These lines are likely representing some sort of measurement or data related to these two entities. <chunk_seperator> 4.2.2.2. Diagram signal logic 

![59_image_0.png]( The image displays a graph with two lines, one labeled ""True"" and the other labeled ""Reciprocal."" The line labeled ""True"" is positioned above the line labeled ""Reciprocal,"" indicating that it represents a higher value or dominance in comparison to the reciprocal line. This relationship between the two lines suggests that the true value can be derived from the reciprocal value, and vice versa. The graph provides an insight into the relationship between these two variables, helping to understand their interdependence better.)

## 4.2.3. Topology <chunk_seperator> ## 7.18.6.7 Io_Errortype Io_Pwd_Countset ( Ubyte1 Count_Channel, Ubyte2 **Count** )

## 7.18.6.8 Io_Errortype Io_Pwd_Getcurrent ( Ubyte1 Pwd_Channel, Ubyte2 ∗Const **Current,** Bool ∗Const **Fresh** )

Get the current feedback of a timer input channel.

Parameters <chunk_seperator> In addition to the main lines, there are several smaller lines in the graph, which could be used for additional information or context. The overall appearance of the graph suggests that it might be a part of a scientific study or analysis involving the two entities represented by the blue and red lines.)

 **In the event of a recessive signal status, the difference voltage is ~ 0V.** 
 **In the event of a dominant signal status, the difference voltage is ~ 2V.** 
This diagram explains why a dominant signal status is able to overwrite a recessive one. This mechanism is used for the priorisation of messages; see chapters 4.2 Hardware properties and *4.3.2 Meaning of the* CAN ID.

As explained in chapter *4.2 Hardware* properties, **the topology of CAN is the Bus. This means, the CAN has a direct connection line, which reaches from the first to the last participant.** 
Each individual participant is directly connected to the signal lines CAN-H and CAN-L. At both ends of the main bus (the longest direct connection line) the bus line has to be terminated using a resistance of 120 Ohm. 

For the length of the main bus as well as for the length of the individual stub cable between the bus and the network participants, the maximum line lengths, described in chapter *4.2.5* Transmission **speed, should be strictly adhered to.** 

![59_image_1.png]( The image shows a diagram of an electrical system with multiple lines and connections. There are several busbars labeled ""busline"" that connect different parts of the system.

The safety measures of the HY-TTC 500 platform cannot detect systematic application errors (e.g. wrong calculation algorithms or bit-modification in RAM variables). The system integrator **shall** apply appropriate measures to the application development process for handling such errors, by means of e.g.: <chunk_seperator> In the following example for the CAN protocol, one individual participant having the Node ID

## 4.4.3. Heartbeat

The heartbeat protocol serves one participant to inform all the participants within the network about its current opterating state. 

This service is implemented according to the *4.3.5.1 Producer - Consumer* **model.** 
The message needs to be activated explicitly and is sent on a cyclical basis. Via the object 
""*Producer* heartbeat time"" **the heartbeat can be activated and the repeat rate can be configured.** 
Should the heartbeat consumer report the absence of a heartbeat message, it will inform its superordinate application software about this event. The application should then react in the appropriate way. The message has a data length of one byte, which reports the current state of the participant. <chunk_seperator> after having waited a further defined period, the manager sends an additional signal to change to ""*Stopped*"". 

 **The manager again attempts to write onto the object 5300 in the device (node ID**

o The inquiry is not responded by the device. 

The participant is configured as follows: <chunk_seperator> <table_63>[{'Field': 'Content'}, {'---------': '-------------------------------------------', '-----------': '-------------------'}, {'name': 'Participant is in the ""Operational"" mode.'}, {'7Fh': 'Pre-Operational  Participant is in', 'the': '""Pre-operational""'}]</table_63>

Depending on the device variant, up to three separate safety switches are available, each one allocated to a predefined group of PWM high side stages. Details of the safety switch allocation can be found in the HY‑TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM].

Due to the PWM high side stages' reverse conducting characteristics, a short circuit to battery voltage at any PWM high side output's connector pin—even those not being used for safety-critical applicationsmight influence the safety integrity of all remaining high side stages sharing the same safety switch, by preventing that single safety switch from de-energizing. To that end, the system integrator is advised to evaluate the criticality of such failures when allocating the HY-TTC 500 platform's connector pins to the system's safety functions. <chunk_seperator> ## Digital Input:

In the digital input configuration, certain failure modes of the timer input stages might not be detectable by the HY-TTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules. Hence, a redundant usage of independent input stages is recommended for safety functions that require a certain diagnostic coverage.

Regardless of the measurement mode, the connected input elements (e.g. switches or sensors) might require the implementation of certain safety mechanisms, as well, to assure failure detection within those elements. Such mechanisms have to be selected according to the possible failure modes and the targeted failure rates.

The gray and white color scheme creates an interesting visual effect that draws attention to the wall's texture and design.)

should be activated for the permanent storage of object changes. 

4.5.1.4. Object serving as process data content Some entries in the OD can be used for the transmission via a process value (PDO). The main advantage is that, doing this, the content of the object does not have to be requested explicitly via a SDO command any more, but is permanently available in the context of process data transmission. 

The object properties ""*mappable***"" defines that the content of the object can be transmitted** 
via a PDO; see chapters *4.6.2 PDO* and *4.6.2.3 PDO Mapping*. <chunk_seperator> Below table shows the general structure of the OD in a device. It has been generated as an extract, based on the inclination sensor HIT (HE-926037-0008.eds). The column ""value"" corresponds with the possible content of an object which can be read out via of the addressing <index>.<subindex> by means of a *SDO commands* **from an existing device.** 

The colums ""Name"", ""Object type"", ""Access"", ""Data type"" provide a more detailed description of the properties of the entry; see also chapter *4.5.7 EDS Electronic Data Sheet*.
Question:  What is the purpose of activating an object, and how is it done?","The purpose of activating an object is to assign a particular activation value to the object, which enables the object to be used for a specific function or process. This activation value is usually stored in a specific location, such as a register or a memory location, and is used to control the behavior of the object.

Activating an object is done by assigning the activation value to the object through a specific command or instruction, such as a Store Parameter (SP) command. This command writes the activation value to the object, which then becomes active and available for use.

For example, in the context of the provided information, activating an object might involve assigning a particular value to the object's PDO (Process Data Object) column, which would then enable the object to be used for a specific function or process.

In summary, the purpose of activating an object is to enable it for a specific function or process by assigning an activation value, and this is done through a specific command or instruction that writes the activation value to the object."

Question:  What is the purpose of the PDO transmission?","

The purpose of the PDO (Process Data Object) transmission is to send heartbeat messages on a cyclic basis. This means that the device is able to send periodic messages, known as heartbeats, to indicate its operational status. The PDO transmission is used to define the transmission type, which can be either cyclic, synchronous, or event-controlled.

The PDO transmission is configured using various parameters, including the transmission type, index, sub-index, and access type. These parameters define how the PDO transmission will be processed and received by the device. The PDO transmission also supports RPDO (Redundancy Process Data Object) communication, which allows for redundant transmission of process data objects.

The PDO transmission is used to transmit process data objects, which are used to convey information between devices. The PDO transmission is an essential feature of the device, as it enables the device to communicate its operational status and transmit process data objects to other devices.

In summary, the purpose of the PDO transmission is to provide a means of communication between devices, enabling them to exchange process data objects and operational status information. This feature is critical for ensuring the reliable operation of devices in various applications."

Question:  What is the structure of the PDO transmission?","The structure of the PDO transmission is defined by the RPDO communication parameter, which has its own structure for the definition of its individual transmission type. Each available RPDO has its own structure, and the first RPDO communication parameter has the index 1400, the second has 1401, and so on.

The structure of the PDO transmission includes the following elements:

1. Index: This is the unique identifier for the RPDO communication parameter, ranging from 1400h to 15FFh.

2. Sub-index: This is the highest sub-index supported by the device, which is 1400h for the first RPDO communication parameter.

3. Type: This defines the transmission type of the RPDO, which can be one of the following:
   - 0: Acyclic synchronous
   - 1: Synchronous with each SYNC
   - 2: Synchronous with every 2nd SYNC
   - n: Synchronous with every nth SYNC
   - 254: Event-controlled manufacturer-specific event options
   - 255: Event-controlled device-specific event options

4. COB-ID: This is used for the calculation of the operating CAN ID under which the RPDO will be accepted and received.

5. Inhibit time: This is the minimum delay for the RPDO processing as a multiple of 100 µs. A value of 0 will deactivate this blocking period.

6. Event timer: This is the monitoring interval for RPDO processing. When the timer is set (> 0), the time between two RPDOs will be measured and reported to the device software if exceeded.

Question:  What is the significance of the black and white colors in the logo?","The significance of the black and white colors in the logo, as depicted in [87_image_0.png], [87_image_1.png], and [89_image_0.png], lies in their ability to create a strong visual impact. The high contrast between the black and white elements makes the logo stand out prominently against its surroundings. This contrast is particularly effective in creating a visually appealing design, as it allows the logo to be easily recognizable and memorable.

In the context of the device's ability to send heartbeat messages on a cyclic basis, the black and white colors may also symbolize the binary nature of the device's communication, where 0s and 1s are used to represent different states or values. The use of black and white colors in the logo may be a subtle nod to this binary nature of the device's communication.

Furthermore, the black and white colors may also represent the simplicity and clarity of the device's communication. The absence of any other colors in the logo suggests a focus on the essential aspects of the device's functionality, without any unnecessary embellishments. This simplicity and clarity are reflected in the device's ability to send heartbeat messages on a cyclic basis, which provides a straightforward and reliable means of communication.

Overall, the significance of the black and white colors in the logo lies in their ability to create a visually appealing design, symbolize the binary nature of the device's communication, and represent the simplicity and clarity of the device's functionality."

Question:  What is the purpose of the ""RPDO mapping parameter"" object, and how many different sub-entries can it support?","The ""RPDO mapping parameter"" object is used to define the process value parameter objects to be transmitted by this PDO. It usually supports up to 8 + 1 different sub-entries. The first entry defines the amount of valid sub-entries, which means the values to be transmitted subsequently (process value parameters). 

For instance, if the content of this object is set to = 2, the first two of the subsequent sub-index objects must have a valid process value parameter object reference. In that structure, the entries need to be filled in a strictly sequential order and without leaving any gaps. If the object is set to = 0 (1600.0 = 0), the transmission of the RPDO is deactivated."

Question:  How are the process value parameter objects referenced in the RPDO, and what determines the byte position in the CAN message data block?","The process value parameter objects in the RPDO (Receive Process Data Object) are referenced through a specific structure. The first ""RPDO mapping parameter"" object has an index of 1600, the second one has an index of 1601, and so on. Each available RPDO has its own structure for defining the process value parameter objects to be transmitted by this PDO.

The ""RPDO mapping parameter"" object usually supports up to 8 + 1 different sub-entries. The first entry defines the number of valid sub-entries, which means the number of process value parameter objects to be transmitted. The value of this object determines how many of the subsequent sub-index objects have a valid process value parameter object reference.

For instance, if the content of this object is set to 2, the first two of the subsequent sub-index objects must have a valid process value parameter object reference. The entries need to be filled in a strictly sequential order and without leaving any gaps.

The byte position in the CAN message data block of the RPDO is determined by the object content. The first object to be mapped has a byte position of 0 in the data block of the CAN message. The position of subsequent objects is calculated depending on the previous object.

Each object to be mapped has a specific structure, which includes an object reference, object index, sub-index, and data length. The object reference is subdivided into three sections: object reference, object index, and sub-index. The data length depends on the data type of the referenced process value parameter object.

For example, the first object to be mapped has an index of 1600h 1, which references a process value parameter object. The byte position in the data block of the CAN message is byte 0. The required data length in the CAN data block depends on the data length of the data type of the referenced process value parameter object.

In summary, the process value parameter objects in the RPDO are referenced through a specific structure, and the byte position in the CAN message data block is determined by the object content and calculated depending on the previous object."

## Tpdo Mapping Parameter 1 1A00H **Record**

Each available TPDO has its own structure for the definition of the process value parameter objects to be transmitted by this PDO. The ""TPDO mapping parameter"" object usually supports up to 8 + 1 different sub-entries. The first entry defines the amount of valid sub-entries, while the following entries define the values to be transmitted subsequently (process value parameters).

Question:  What is the purpose of the ""TPDO mapping parameter"" object in the PDO structure?","The ""TPDO mapping parameter"" object, specifically 1A00H, serves the purpose of defining the number of valid sub-entries in the PDO (Process Data Object) structure. This object determines how many process value parameters will be transmitted in the TPDO (Target Process Data Object). 

The value of this object, which is an unsigned 8-bit integer, specifies the number of subsequent sub-entries that are valid. For instance, if the content of this object is set to 2, the first two subsequent sub-index objects must have a valid process value parameter. These entries need to be filled in a strictly sequential order without leaving any gaps. 

In essence, the ""TPDO mapping parameter"" object plays a crucial role in controlling the transmission of process value parameters in the TPDO, allowing for efficient and structured data exchange between devices in the CANopen network."

For the timer input mode, the I/O driver's diagnostic modules allow to internally check the input signal for a predefined frequency and pulse width range. Apart from that, the application software can implement appropriate measures on their own, as well. Encoder Input:
The I/O driver's diagnostic modules allow defining a lower and upper threshold for the encoder's count value.

## Analog Input:

Similarly, the analog input measurement is not equipped with automatically enabled safety mechanisms. 

Therefore, no safety mechanisms can be claimed by the system integrator and additional measures have to be enabled, if the overall safety function requires diagnostic coverage for the analog input function.

## 7.1. Ascii Table

Below is a list of the portrayable characters of the ASCII character set. By summing the horizontal and vertical identification code, the numeric value belonging to the particular character can be determined. The ASCII character encoding forms the basis of most of the character sets used for a standardised representation of the most important characters. 

Particular language-specific special characters, such as the ß **which is part of the German** 
written language, cannot be displayed using ASCII encoding. For the representation of these characters, there are special international character sets which will not be referred to herein, as special characters are not supported by the devices.

The process values of the additional manufacturer-specific measurement channels can be transferred via a *TPDO*. 

However, this type of measurement channels will not be supported at all or at least not fully supported by each device, which means, the objects listed below may be only partly available or not at all. If these objects, however, are provided by a device, their significance corresponds with the description below. The function principle of the objects is based on the device profile CiA 404. <chunk_seperator> Checksum 2010h **0 UNSIGNED32 ro**

## 4.5.5.2. Additional Manufacturer-Specific Measurement Channels

Some devices offer additional measurement channels which complete the standard measurement variables, such as pressure in a pressure sensor, which increases the benefit of the device. Additional manufacturer-specific measurement channels are able to provide ""real"" measurement signals with a defined specification in the data sheet, such as accuracy or temperature coefficient, but also internal signals, such as the device temperature. 

The device-specific section of the documentation under chapter 3.5.5 *Additional manufacturer-specific measurement* **channels. also provides information on whether a device has manufacturer-specific measurement** <chunk_seperator> For the management of the Baud rate, there are two objects available.

## Inputs
Question:  What type of information can be provided by additional manufacturer-specific measurement channels?",
"You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the context that the user gives to answer the question. Treat the context as your internal knowledge, hence do not explicitly mention the ""context"" in your answer like ""Based on the provided context..."".If your answer relates to any image description given below, you should refer explicitly to the image ID in your answer with the format [image_id.png].Give a long and detailed answer.","Context: Whether access will be permitted or not to a particular object, can be determined from the object authorisation (see chapter *4.5.1.2 Object* access types) and from the current operation status of the device. See chapter *4.4.1 Overview network* **conditions.** 
The data type of the object (see chapter *4.5.7 EDS Electronic Data Sheet* and *DataType*) 
controls the process of the SDO communication. All objects whose data type is 32 bit and shorter can be read or written to directly by means of a single SDO command ""expedited"" , 
i.e. INTEGER32 or *REAL32***. Objects whose data type is longer than 32 bit have to be read** 
or written to via a sequence of interrelated commands ""segmented"". <chunk_seperator> The particular COB-ID of the SDO corresponds to the ""Pre defined Connection Set"" defined in the CiA 301 and cannot be altered.

## 7.7.2 Digital Output Protection

Each digital output is individually protected against overcurrent. Whenever a fatal overcurrent situation is detected on any safe or unsafe digital output, the output is disabled by software. Note that disabled by software means that the output is set to low but the state of the safety switch (if configured) remains unchanged.

When entering the protection state, the digital output has to remain in this state for the given wait time. After this wait time the digital output can be reenabled via function **IO_DO_ResetProtection()**. Note that the number of reenabling operations for a single digital output is limited to 10. Refer to function IO_DO_ResetProtection() for more information on how to reenable a digital output.

Detailed information about fatal overcurrent situations, **the reaction time and wait time are listed in** the following table. <chunk_seperator> For the SDO the Client/Server access is used as a communication type, see chapter **4.3.5.3** Request - Response**. The server is always the network participant, whose objects will be** 
accessed - which is the device to write on in this case. The client is usually a superordinate The client communicates a ""request"" command to the server, saying what it is intending to do and the server always responds by sending a ""response"" command, indicating whether the access has been successful or if an error has occurred, see chapter **4.6.1.5 SDO abort** transfer (abort).

 1 <chunk_seperator> If the server detects an error while processing a request command, it will report it to the client sending an ""SDO abort transfer"" response. The data field of the SDO command serves to transmit a cancel code (error number). The numeric value is shown as a *UNSIGNED32*and the *Bit order* **is to be adhered to.** The command code is always 80h. 

This example shows the attempt to write a value into the object 7654 ""**manufacturer-specific**
