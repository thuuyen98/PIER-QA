La condition requise pour cette fonction est naturellement l'utilisation de capteurs rapides correspondants adaptés. La fonction la plus attractive de l'appareil HMG 3010 est de pouvoir enregistrer sous forme de courbe de mesure les processus dynamiques d'une machine et de les représenter graphiquement - et cela même en ligne en temps réel. L'HMG 3010 est équipé d'un logiciel spécialement développé garantissant la saisie et le traitement rapides des données. Une courbe de mesure peut contenir jusqu'à 500 000 valeurs.

## 3 Getting Started

TTControl GmbH recommends using the HY-TTC 500 Starter Kit, because it includes all components required for smooth development. There are two variants of the HY-TTC 500 Starter Kit available: one for C programming (with JTAG-Adapter and open housing) and one for CODESYS programming. This Quick Start Guide is for the C programming variant (see Figure 3.2 on the following page). For the CODESYS programming variant, see [5]. Note that the Ethernet USB adapter is only part of the starter kit if the corresponding HY-TTC 500 ECU is equipped with an Ethernet interface. <chunk_seperator> {'5.4': 'Add button'}, {'5.5': 'Add Repository dialog'}, {'5.6': 'TI Compiler Updates branch'}, {'5.7': 'ARM Compiler Tools 5.1.6'}, {'5.8': 'Contents of the Get_Started directory'}, {'5.9': 'The examples and template directories'}, {'5.10': 'Settings.mk'}, {'5.11': 'Select new wizard page'}, {'5.12': 'Import Existing Code page'}, {'5.13': 'Browse For Folder dialog'}, {'5.14': 'Console pane with successful build'}, {'5.15': 'Includes'}, {'5.16': 'Application Descriptor Block (APDB)'}, {'5.17': 'Application initialization'}, {'5.18': 'Application loop'}, {'5.19': 'Linking constant data to the external flash and/or application configuration data', '.': '31'}, {'5.20': 'Lauterbach Base Station'}, {'5.21': 'Trace32 Software'}, {'5.22': 'Chosse Destination Location page'}, {'5.23': 'Installation Type page'}, {'5.24': 'Setup Type page'}, {'5.25': 'TRACE32 Product Type page'}, {'5.26': 'Maintenance Notice page'}, {'5.27': 'Debugger Interface Type page'}, {'5.28': 'OS Selection page'},

As explained in chapter *4.2 Hardware* properties, **the topology of CAN is the Bus. This means, the CAN has a direct connection line, which reaches from the first to the last participant.** 
Each individual participant is directly connected to the signal lines CAN-H and CAN-L. At both ends of the main bus (the longest direct connection line) the bus line has to be terminated using a resistance of 120 Ohm. 

For the length of the main bus as well as for the length of the individual stub cable between the bus and the network participants, the maximum line lengths, described in chapter *4.2.5* Transmission **speed, should be strictly adhered to.** 

![59_image_1.png]( The image shows a diagram of an electrical system with multiple lines and connections. There are several busbars labeled ""busline"" that connect different parts of the system.

Question:  What is the significance of clearing the check box ""Show only the latest versions of available software"" in the Install dialog?","The significance of clearing the check box ""Show only the latest versions of available software"" in the Install dialog is that it allows the user to view and select from all available versions of the software, not just the latest ones. 

By default, the check box is selected, which means the Install dialog will only display the latest versions of the software. However, if the user clears this check box, they will be able to see and choose from a list of all available versions, including older or previous versions of the software.

## 5.7.2 General

Every program must include at least the header files **IO_Driver.h** and **APDB.h** (see Figure 5.15 on the current page). The Application Descriptor Block (APDB) is a 128-byte structure that is used by download tools and the bootloader to update the application and do CRC checks. The structure Apdb_t must be defined (see Figure 5.16 on the following page). <chunk_seperator> 7.15.2.58 \#define IO_ADC_57 IO_PIN_167 alternative ADC function for **IO_PVG_05**

Constant data is linked to the application region by default. However, it can also be linked to the external flash memory (if available) or to the application configuration data region. The major difference is the integrity protection of their respective contents. While constant data linked to the external flash memory is protected by the application CRC, the application configuration data region's integrity must be ensured by the application itself. Figure 5.19 on the facing page depicts an example of how to link constant data to the external flash memory as well as to the application configuration data region.

## Figure 5.19: Linking Constant Data To The External Flash And/Or Application Configuration Data 5.7.5 Safety Configuration

For safety-critical applications, every safety-critical IO pin can be initialized with a safety configuration. Please refer to **HY-TTC_500_Series_C_API_Manual.chm** [4] for further details.

To enable any outputs, the I/O Driver has to be configured with a valid safety configuration. The I/O Driver safety configuration consists of several elements:
- **command_period [**µs]: Sets the period at which the application cycle is executed.

Important: The **command_period** is checked by the watchdog and has to meet the window configuration.

- **window_size [%]**: Configures the size of the window for the watchdog which checks the command_period. The application cycle has to fulfill those timing requirements. <chunk_seperator> <table_105>[{'Pin No.': 'Function'}, {'-----------': '------------------------------'}, {'P118': 'Negative Power Supply (BAT-)'}, {'P119': 'Negative Power Supply (BAT-)'}, {'P120': 'Negative Power Supply (BAT-)'}, {'P121': 'Negative Power Supply (BAT-)'}, {'P142': 'Negative Power Supply (BAT-)'}, {'P143': 'Negative Power Supply (BAT-)'}, {'P144': 'Negative Power Supply (BAT-)'}, {'P145': 'Negative Power Supply (BAT-)'}]</table_105>
Supply pins for BAT- connection. The HY-TTC 500 housing is not directly connected to BAT-, for more information see Section 6.4 on page **195.** TTControl GmbH recommends to use these pins in parallel and the maximum possible wire size (FLRY type) in case of maximum load current to reduce voltage **drop and prevent overheating of the** crimp contact.

For safety-critical applications, every safety-critical IO pin can be initialized with a safety configuration. Please refer to **HY-TTC_500_Series_C_API_Manual.chm** [4] for further details.

To enable any outputs, the I/O Driver has to be configured with a valid safety configuration. The I/O Driver safety configuration consists of several elements:
- **command_period [**µs]: Sets the period at which the application cycle is executed.

Important: The **command_period** is checked by the watchdog and has to meet the window configuration.

- **window_size [%]**: Configures the size of the window for the watchdog which checks the command_period. The application cycle has to fulfill those timing requirements. <chunk_seperator> <table_105>[{'Pin No.': 'Function'}, {'-----------': '------------------------------'}, {'P118': 'Negative Power Supply (BAT-)'}, {'P119': 'Negative Power Supply (BAT-)'}, {'P120': 'Negative Power Supply (BAT-)'}, {'P121': 'Negative Power Supply (BAT-)'}, {'P142': 'Negative Power Supply (BAT-)'}, {'P143': 'Negative Power Supply (BAT-)'}, {'P144': 'Negative Power Supply (BAT-)'}, {'P145': 'Negative Power Supply (BAT-)'}]</table_105>

For safety-critical applications, every safety-critical IO pin can be initialized with a safety configuration. Please refer to **HY-TTC_500_Series_C_API_Manual.chm** [4] for further details.

To enable any outputs, the I/O Driver has to be configured with a valid safety configuration. The I/O Driver safety configuration consists of several elements:
- **command_period [**µs]: Sets the period at which the application cycle is executed.

Important: The **command_period** is checked by the watchdog and has to meet the window configuration.

- **window_size [%]**: Configures the size of the window for the watchdog which checks the command_period. The application cycle has to fulfill those timing requirements. <chunk_seperator> <table_105>[{'Pin No.': 'Function'}, {'-----------': '------------------------------'}, {'P118': 'Negative Power Supply (BAT-)'}, {'P119': 'Negative Power Supply (BAT-)'}, {'P120': 'Negative Power Supply (BAT-)'}, {'P121': 'Negative Power Supply (BAT-)'}, {'P142': 'Negative Power Supply (BAT-)'}, {'P143': 'Negative Power Supply (BAT-)'}, {'P144': 'Negative Power Supply (BAT-)'}, {'P145': 'Negative Power Supply (BAT-)'}]</table_105>

Constant data is linked to the application region by default. However, it can also be linked to the external flash memory (if available) or to the application configuration data region. The major difference is the integrity protection of their respective contents. While constant data linked to the external flash memory is protected by the application CRC, the application configuration data region's integrity must be ensured by the application itself.

Question:  What is the role of the watchdog in relation to the **command_period** and **window_size** configurations?","The watchdog plays a crucial role in relation to the **command_period** and **window_size** configurations. According to the provided information, the **command_period** is checked by the watchdog, and it has to meet the window configuration. This implies that the watchdog is responsible for monitoring and ensuring that the application cycle, which is executed at the period set by **command_period**, falls within the timing requirements defined by **window_size**.

In other words, the watchdog acts as a guardian that verifies whether the application cycle is executed within the allowed time window. If the application cycle exceeds the permitted time window or fails to meet the timing requirements, the watchdog will likely trigger a reset or an error response to prevent the system from operating outside of its safety-critical boundaries.

This watchdog functionality is essential in safety-critical applications, where predictable and reliable operation is paramount. By ensuring that the application cycle adheres to the configured timing requirements, the watchdog helps to maintain the integrity and safety of the system."

Question:  What is the purpose of the Lauterbach Base Station and its related components?","The purpose of the Lauterbach Base Station and its related components is to facilitate debugging and testing of electronic systems, specifically in the context of the HY-TTC 580 Starter Kit. The Lauterbach Base Station, along with its associated components such as the Power Debug Interface USB 3 LA-3500, Lauterbach Debug Cable JTAG-COR TEX-A/R LA-7843, Lauterbach AC/DC power supply adapter, and USB connector, enables the connection of the HY-TTC 580 with the Lauterbach debugger.

The Lauterbach Base Station serves as an interface between the HY-TTC 580 and the debugging tools, allowing developers to test, debug, and troubleshoot their systems. The Power Debug Interface USB 3 LA-3500 provides a connection point for the debugging process, while the Lauterbach Debug Cable JTAG-COR TEX-A/R LA-7843 facilitates the communication between the HY-TTC 580 and the debugger. The Lauterbach AC/DC power supply adapter ensures a stable power supply to the system, and the USB connector enables the connection of the Lauterbach Base Station to a PC.

In essence, the Lauterbach Base Station and its related components form a comprehensive debugging setup, enabling developers to thoroughly test and refine their electronic systems, such as the HY-TTC 580, to ensure their optimal performance and reliability."

- **Examples for PWM API functions**

## 7.19.2 Pwm Output Protection

Each PWM output is individually protected against overcurrent. Whenever a fatal overcurrent situation (i.e., a current greater than 5.5A) is detected on any safe or unsafe PWM output, the output is disabled by software latest within 7ms. Note that disabled by software means that the duty cycle of the output signal is set to 0% but the states of the safety switch and PWM power stage remain unchanged. When entering the protection state, the PWM output has to remain in this state for at least 10s. After this wait time the PWM output can be reenabled via function IO_PWM_ResetProtection()**. Note**
that the number of reenabling operations for a single PWM output is limited to 10. Refer to function IO_PWM_ResetProtection() **for more information on how to reenable a PWM output.**

## 7.19.3.1 Pwm Initialization Example

// Setup a PWM output <chunk_seperator> The image is accompanied by a text description that highlights the different LEDs in various positions across the component. The text also indicates that there are four LEDs in total, with one positioned at the top left corner, another on the right side of the component, and two more located near the center.) 

Debug LEDs The LEDs LED0. . . LED2 shown in Figure 5.42 on this page are for debugging. They are controlled by the **IO_DEBUG_SetOutputPin()** function. See [4] for details. They are completely controllable by the application.

Signal pins The signal pins on the JTAG adapter board (see Figure 5.43 on the next page) indicate the inverted status of the DONE LED and the Debug LEDs. That is, if a LED is ON, the corresponding signal pin has low voltage (0).

Note: The signal pins shown in Figure 5.43 on the following page are unprotected CMOS outputs.

Any external voltage applied on these pins can damage the ECU. <chunk_seperator> Note **1 Inductive load transients will be clamped internally to <33 V referred to GND.** Note **2 With 3 A load current in a system with 32 V supply voltage, this corresponds to**
a maximum inductivity of 100 mH. For higher inductivities see Section 6.3 on page **195.**
Note **3 This is the sum of all inductive switch-off events on all eight low side outputs.**
With lower energy, faster switching is possible as the limit is the average power.

## 4.15.5 Characteristics Of Low-Side Digital Output Tecu **= -40. . . +125** °C <chunk_seperator> Due to the sensor supply's nature of providing a steady, defined output voltage, the analog feedback measurement is considered a reliable safety mechanism with a high diagnostic coverage.

- **Examples for PWM API functions**

## 7.19.2 Pwm Output Protection

Each PWM output is individually protected against overcurrent. Whenever a fatal overcurrent situation (i.e., a current greater than 5.5A) is detected on any safe or unsafe PWM output, the output is disabled by software latest within 7ms. Note that disabled by software means that the duty cycle of the output signal is set to 0% but the states of the safety switch and PWM power stage remain unchanged. When entering the protection state, the PWM output has to remain in this state for at least 10s. After this wait time the PWM output can be reenabled via function IO_PWM_ResetProtection()**. Note**
that the number of reenabling operations for a single PWM output is limited to 10. Refer to function IO_PWM_ResetProtection() **for more information on how to reenable a PWM output.**

// Setup a PWM output <chunk_seperator> The image is accompanied by a text description that highlights the different LEDs in various positions across the component. The text also indicates that there are four LEDs in total, with one positioned at the top left corner, another on the right side of the component, and two more located near the center.) 

Debug LEDs The LEDs LED0. . . LED2 shown in Figure 5.42 on this page are for debugging. They are controlled by the **IO_DEBUG_SetOutputPin()** function. See [4] for details. They are completely controllable by the application.

Signal pins The signal pins on the JTAG adapter board (see Figure 5.43 on the next page) indicate the inverted status of the DONE LED and the Debug LEDs. That is, if a LED is ON, the corresponding signal pin has low voltage (0).

Note: The signal pins shown in Figure 5.43 on the following page are unprotected CMOS outputs.

Any external voltage applied on these pins can damage the ECU. <chunk_seperator> Note **1 Inductive load transients will be clamped internally to <33 V referred to GND.** Note **2 With 3 A load current in a system with 32 V supply voltage, this corresponds to**
a maximum inductivity of 100 mH. For higher inductivities see Section 6.3 on page **195.**
Note **3 This is the sum of all inductive switch-off events on all eight low side outputs.**
With lower energy, faster switching is possible as the limit is the average power.
