Inductive loads in PWM operation generate current through the freewheeling diodes, but these diodes have, at the same current, a power dissipation that is **several times greater than the high-side** switches themselves. Therefore the duty cycle has a great influence on the power dissipation of the output devices. The duty cycle results from the relationship between coil resistance and supply voltage. A low resistance at a high supply voltage is the worst combination, because it **results in a low duty cycle and, thus, in** a long conduction time of the diodes.

## 6.3.2 Inductive Loads At Low Side Switches

For load inductivities >100 mH, either the current has to be lower or an external freewheeling diode or clamping device parallel to the coil has to be used. The clamping device has to clamp below 50 V. <chunk_seperator> <table_1>[{'Approval Name': 'Function'}, {'----------------------': '-----------------------'}, {'Dominik Langer': 'Author'}, {'Kamil Schostok': 'Project Manager'}, {'Christiana Seethaler': 'Department Head'}, {'Fabian Rier': 'Configuration Manager'}, {'Ralph Hois': 'Quality Engineer'}]</table_1>

Subject to changes and corrections <chunk_seperator> ## 6.3 Inductive Loads 6.3.1 Inductive Loads At Pwm Outputs

Inductive loads in PWM operation generate current through the freewheeling diodes, but these diodes have, at the same current, a power dissipation that is **several times greater than the high-side** switches themselves. Therefore the duty cycle has a great influence on the power dissipation of the output devices. The duty cycle results from the relationship between coil resistance and supply voltage. A low resistance at a high supply voltage is the worst combination, because it **results in a low duty cycle and, thus, in** a long conduction time of the diodes.

## 6.3.2 Inductive Loads At Low Side Switches

For load inductivities >100 mH, either the current has to be lower or an external freewheeling diode or clamping device parallel to the coil has to be used. The clamping device has to clamp below 50 V. <chunk_seperator> <table_1>[{'Approval Name': 'Function'}, {'----------------------': '-----------------------'}, {'Dominik Langer': 'Author'}, {'Kamil Schostok': 'Project Manager'}, {'Christiana Seethaler': 'Department Head'}, {'Fabian Rier': 'Configuration Manager'}, {'Ralph Hois': 'Quality Engineer'}]</table_1>

## 5.7.3 Help For C Driver Functions

The I/O driver API documentation (**HY-TTC_500_IO_Driver_Manual_V3.1.0.chm** [4]) is available in the compiled HTML format and can be found in **Documentation > Manuals**. It provides a short overview of the available I/O driver functions as well as detailed descriptions of those functions, including parameters, return values and examples.

## 5.7.4 Linking Constant Data
Question:  What is a revision, as defined in the Revision History section of the context?","According to the Revision History section of the Safety Manual (SM) [0_Image_0.Png], a revision is defined as a new edition of the document, which may affect all sections of this document. In other words, a revision is an updated version of the document that can potentially impact any part of the document, introducing changes, corrections, or improvements."

Category: Comment ID: 924316 The current state of the digital high side outputs can be read via the static voltage feedback signals. That way, the application software is able to verify the correct function of the digital high side outputs and activate the safe state in case of dangerous failures. If the independent digital low side outputs are not used as secondary shut-off paths, the system integrator is responsible to provide other means that allow bringing the overall system to a safe state, e.g. by a separate emergency valve that disrupts the hydraulic oil flow and stops any dangerous movements.

This safety mechanism allows to detect a substantial amount of possible hardware failures and—with a proper secondary shut-off path in place—is therefore considered to yield a DC value of 90 %.

## 8.2.9.2 Shut-Off Path Test - - - <chunk_seperator> - The redundant utilization of two separate timer inputs. By comparing the measured values of both sensor inputs, the application can identify sensor failures and change to the safe state.

Category: Comment ID: 924316 The current state of the digital high side outputs can be read via the static voltage feedback signals. That way, the application software is able to verify the correct function of the digital high side outputs and activate the safe state in case of dangerous failures. If the independent digital low side outputs are not used as secondary shut-off paths, the system integrator is responsible to provide other means that allow bringing the overall system to a safe state, e.g. by a separate emergency valve that disrupts the hydraulic oil flow and stops any dangerous movements.

This safety mechanism allows to detect a substantial amount of possible hardware failures and—with a proper secondary shut-off path in place—is therefore considered to yield a DC value of 90 %.

Question:  What was the purpose of adding user requirements for handling safety switch runtime errors, as mentioned in issue75164?","The purpose of adding user requirements for handling safety switch runtime errors, as mentioned in issue75164, was to ensure that the system is designed to handle safety switch runtime errors in a way that meets the safety requirements. This is likely to involve defining how the system should behave when a safety switch runtime error occurs, such as how to handle the error, how to recover from it, and how to prevent it from happening again in the future. This requirement is important to ensure the overall safety and reliability of the system."

Question:  What is the general calculation formula for MTTFd mentioned in issue84150?","The general calculation formula for MTTFd (Mean Time To Failure Dangerous) mentioned in issue84150 is not explicitly stated in the provided table. However, based on the context, it appears that issue84150 is related to a review finding of a document extension, and the formula is likely to be discussed or mentioned in that document.

In general, the MTTFd calculation formula is used to estimate the reliability of a system or component in terms of its ability to perform its safety functions. The formula typically takes into account various factors such as the failure rates of individual components, the system's architecture, and the operating conditions.

A common formula for calculating MTTFd is:

MTTFd = 1 / (λd \* πd)

Where:
λd = the failure rate of the component or system in failures per hour
πd = the probability of a dangerous failure

However, without more information from the document or context, it is difficult to provide a more specific formula or details about the calculation."

The digital (non-PWM) power stages tolerate inrush current **of up to 6 A for 100 ms. Fast accelerating**
motors show first an inrush current peak followed by a reduction in current to less than 50 % of the initial current after 20 ms. In other words, most motors that **start with 6 A drop to less than 4 A in** 100 ms. Motors with that kind of fast acceleration will work properly even with a winding resistance that is lower by a factor of 1.5 (stall current 6 A instead of 4 A).

## 6.5.3.13 Peak Current Unidirectional Drive (Digital Power **Stages Only)**

Single high side power stages tolerate an inrush current that linearly declines from 16 to 6 A in 50 ms. Fast accelerating motors show after an initial current peak a reduction in current to less than 50 % after 20 ms. Motors with that kind of fast acceleration may have a winding resistance that is lower by a factor of 4 (stall current 16 A instead of 4 A). <chunk_seperator> <table_6>[{'------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------': '------------'}, {'Table 11.13.0': '2021-04-28'}]</table_6> <chunk_seperator> <table_63>[{'HS Digital Output': 'Timer Input', 'PVG Output': 'VOUT Output', 'A/D Input (HS Output/PVG/VOUT)': 'Current Loop Input', 'A/D Input (Timer Input)': 'A/D Input (HS Digital Output)', 'A/D Input (LS Digital Output)': 'Analog Current Input 2M', 'Digital Input 2M': 'Analog Current Input 3M', 'Analog Resistance Input 3M': 'Digital Input 3M'}, {'---------------------': '----------------------', '--------------------': '---------------------------', '----------------------------------': '----------------------', '---------------------------': '---------------------------------', '---------------------------------': '---------------------------', '------------------------------': '--------------------'}, {'Pin No.': 'Main Function'}, {'P101': 'HS PWM Output'}, {'P102': 'HS PWM Output'}, {'P103': 'Analog Voltage Input', 'IO_ADC_00': 'IO_ADC_00'}, {'P104': 'Analog Voltage Input', 'IO_ADC_02': 'IO_ADC_02'}, {'P105': 'Analog Voltage Input', 'IO_ADC_04': 'IO_ADC_04'}, {'P106': 'Analog <chunk_seperator> The screen also has a few other elements, such as a keyboard in the lower left corner and a mouse located near the center of the image.

The digital (non-PWM) power stages tolerate inrush current **of up to 6 A for 100 ms. Fast accelerating**
motors show first an inrush current peak followed by a reduction in current to less than 50 % of the initial current after 20 ms. In other words, most motors that **start with 6 A drop to less than 4 A in** 100 ms. Motors with that kind of fast acceleration will work properly even with a winding resistance that is lower by a factor of 1.5 (stall current 6 A instead of 4 A).

## 6.5.3.13 Peak Current Unidirectional Drive (Digital Power **Stages Only)**

Single high side power stages tolerate an inrush current that linearly declines from 16 to 6 A in 50 ms. Fast accelerating motors show after an initial current peak a reduction in current to less than 50 % after 20 ms. Motors with that kind of fast acceleration may have a winding resistance that is lower by a factor of 4 (stall current 16 A instead of 4 A). <chunk_seperator> <table_6>[{'------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------': '------------'}, {'Table 11.13.0': '2021-04-28'}]</table_6> <chunk_seperator> <table_63>[{'HS Digital Output': 'Timer Input', 'PVG Output': 'VOUT Output', 'A/D Input (HS Output/PVG/VOUT)': 'Current Loop Input', 'A/D Input (Timer Input)': 'A/D Input (HS Digital Output)', 'A/D Input (LS Digital Output)': 'Analog Current Input 2M', 'Digital Input 2M': 'Analog Current Input 3M', 'Analog Resistance Input 3M': 'Digital Input 3M'}, {'---------------------': '----------------------', '--------------------': '---------------------------', '----------------------------------': '----------------------', '---------------------------': '---------------------------------', '---------------------------------': '---------------------------', '------------------------------': '--------------------'}, {'Pin No.': 'Main Function'}, {'P101': 'HS PWM Output'}, {'P102': 'HS PWM Output'}, {'P103': 'Analog Voltage Input', 'IO_ADC_00': 'IO_ADC_00'}, {'P104': 'Analog Voltage Input', 'IO_ADC_02': 'IO_ADC_02'}, {'P105': 'Analog Voltage Input', 'IO_ADC_04': 'IO_ADC_04'}, {'P106': 'Analog <chunk_seperator> The screen also has a few other elements, such as a keyboard in the lower left corner and a mouse located near the center of the image.

The digital (non-PWM) power stages tolerate inrush current **of up to 6 A for 100 ms. Fast accelerating**
motors show first an inrush current peak followed by a reduction in current to less than 50 % of the initial current after 20 ms. In other words, most motors that **start with 6 A drop to less than 4 A in** 100 ms. Motors with that kind of fast acceleration will work properly even with a winding resistance that is lower by a factor of 1.5 (stall current 6 A instead of 4 A).

## 6.5.3.13 Peak Current Unidirectional Drive (Digital Power **Stages Only)**

Single high side power stages tolerate an inrush current that linearly declines from 16 to 6 A in 50 ms. Fast accelerating motors show after an initial current peak a reduction in current to less than 50 % after 20 ms. Motors with that kind of fast acceleration may have a winding resistance that is lower by a factor of 4 (stall current 16 A instead of 4 A). <chunk_seperator> <table_6>[{'------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------': '------------'}, {'Table 11.13.0': '2021-04-28'}]</table_6> <chunk_seperator> <table_63>[{'HS Digital Output': 'Timer Input', 'PVG Output': 'VOUT Output', 'A/D Input (HS Output/PVG/VOUT)': 'Current Loop Input', 'A/D Input (Timer Input)': 'A/D Input (HS Digital Output)', 'A/D Input (LS Digital Output)': 'Analog Current Input 2M', 'Digital Input 2M': 'Analog Current Input 3M', 'Analog Resistance Input 3M': 'Digital Input 3M'}, {'---------------------': '----------------------', '--------------------': '---------------------------', '----------------------------------': '----------------------', '---------------------------': '---------------------------------', '---------------------------------': '---------------------------', '------------------------------': '--------------------'}, {'Pin No.': 'Main Function'}, {'P101': 'HS PWM Output'}, {'P102': 'HS PWM Output'}, {'P103': 'Analog Voltage Input', 'IO_ADC_00': 'IO_ADC_00'}, {'P104': 'Analog Voltage Input', 'IO_ADC_02': 'IO_ADC_02'}, {'P105': 'Analog Voltage Input', 'IO_ADC_04': 'IO_ADC_04'}, {'P106': 'Analog <chunk_seperator> The screen also has a few other elements, such as a keyboard in the lower left corner and a mouse located near the center of the image.

Question:  What is the purpose of the Safety Concept Overview in the context of safety-critical systems?","In the context of safety-critical systems, the purpose of the Safety Concept Overview, as described in [table_7.png], is to provide a comprehensive outline of the safety concept and its underlying principles. This overview is essential in ensuring the safe operation of safety-critical systems, which are systems whose failure could result in significant harm to people, the environment, or both.

The Safety Concept Overview serves as a foundation for the development and implementation of safety-critical systems, providing a clear understanding of the safety requirements, safety functions, and safety-critical system components. It outlines the safety lifecycle, including the identification of hazards, risk assessment, and the implementation of safety measures to mitigate or eliminate these risks.

The purpose of the Safety Concept Overview can be broken down into several key aspects:

1. **Definition of the safe state**: The Safety Concept Overview defines the safe state of the system, which is the state in which the system operates without posing a risk to people or the environment.

2. **Identification of safety-critical components**: It identifies the safety-critical components of the system, which are the components whose failure could lead to a hazardous situation.

3. **Safety function allocation**: The Safety Concept Overview allocates safety functions to specific system components, ensuring that each safety function is implemented correctly.

4. **Failure reaction and error handling**: It outlines the failure reaction and error handling mechanisms in place to mitigate the effects of system failures or errors.

5. **Safety lifecycle management**: The Safety Concept Overview provides a framework for managing the safety lifecycle, including the identification of hazards, risk assessment, and the implementation of safety measures.

In summary, the purpose of the Safety Concept Overview is to provide a comprehensive framework for ensuring the safe operation of safety-critical systems, by outlining the safety concept, safety functions, and safety-critical system components, and providing a clear understanding of the safety requirements and safety lifecycle management."

Question:  How do the IEC 61508 and ISO 13849 standards relate to the safety lifecycle of a system?","The IEC 61508 and ISO 13849 standards are both related to the safety lifecycle of a system, but they focus on different aspects of safety.

IEC 61508 is an international standard that provides guidelines for the functional safety of electrical, electronic, and programmable electronic safety-related systems. It focuses on the overall safety lifecycle of a system, including the development, operation, and maintenance phases. The standard provides a framework for identifying and mitigating safety risks, and for ensuring that safety functions are implemented and maintained throughout the system's lifecycle.

ISO 13849, on the other hand, is a standard that specifically focuses on the safety of machinery and the safety-related parts of control systems. It provides guidelines for the design, construction, and testing of safety-related parts of control systems, including the safety functions and safety-related systems.

In terms of their relationship to the safety lifecycle, both standards are concerned with ensuring that safety is integrated into the system development process from the outset. They provide guidelines for identifying and mitigating safety risks, and for ensuring that safety functions are implemented and maintained throughout the system's lifecycle.

In the context of the safety lifecycle, IEC 61508 and ISO 13849 can be seen as complementary standards. IEC 61508 provides a broader framework for functional safety, while ISO 13849 provides more specific guidance on the safety of machinery and control systems.

In the table provided [table_7], the safety lifecycle is mentioned in section 2, which includes references to IEC 61508, ISO 13849, and ISO 25119. This suggests that the safety lifecycle is a key concept that underlies the development and implementation of safety-related systems, and that these standards provide important guidelines for ensuring safety throughout the lifecycle of a system.

In summary, IEC 61508 and ISO 13849 are both important standards that relate to the safety lifecycle of a system. While they have different focuses, they are both concerned with ensuring that safety is integrated into the system development process from the outset, and that safety functions are implemented and maintained throughout the system's lifecycle."

Question:  What is the definition of a safe state in the context of safety-critical systems, and how is it achieved?","In the context of safety-critical systems, a safe state refers to a condition where the system is in a stable and non-hazardous state, ensuring the safety of people, the environment, and the system itself. According to the provided context, specifically in section 3.1.2, ""Definition of the Safe State"" [image_id.png], a safe state is achieved when the system is in a condition where it does not pose any risk or harm to its surroundings.

To achieve a safe state, safety-critical systems must be designed and implemented with safety functions that ensure the system's behavior is predictable and safe, even in the presence of faults or errors. This can be achieved through various means, such as:

1. **Safety Function**: Implementing safety functions that monitor the system's behavior and take corrective action when necessary to prevent hazardous situations. (Section 3.1.1, ""Safety Function"")

2. **Failure Reaction**: Designing the system to react appropriately in case of errors or faults, ensuring a safe state is maintained. This includes failure reaction time, which is the time it takes for the system to respond to a failure and transition to a safe state. (Section 3.1.4, ""Failure Reaction in Case of Errors"")

3. **Safety-critical System Components**: Ensuring that all system components, including hardware and software, are designed and tested to meet safety requirements and standards, such as IEC 61508, ISO 13849, and ISO 25119. (Section 3.1.3, ""Safety-critical System Components"")

4. **Redundancy and Diversity**: Implementing redundant and diverse system components to ensure that if one component fails, the system can still maintain a safe state.

5. **Regular Testing and Validation**: Regularly testing and validating the system to ensure it meets safety requirements and can maintain a safe state in the presence of faults or errors.

By incorporating these design principles and safety measures, safety-critical systems can achieve a safe state, ensuring the safety of people, the environment, and the system itself."

Question:  What are the different types of power supply stages, and how do they relate to the overall system architecture?","Based on the provided table of contents, the different types of power supply stages mentioned are:

1. PWM High Side Stages (Section 4.3.1)
2. Digital High Side Stages (Section 4.3.2)
3. Digital Low Side Stages (Section 4.3.3)

These power supply stages are part of the overall system architecture, specifically in the context of safety-critical system components (Section 3.1.3). The power supply stages are related to the safety concept overview (Section w) and are an essential part of the safety lifecycle (Section 2).

The PWM High Side Stages, Digital High Side Stages, and Digital Low Side Stages are all components of the power supply system, which is responsible for providing power to the various components of the system. The power supply stages are critical to the overall system architecture as they ensure the reliable operation of the system.

In the context of safety, the power supply stages play a crucial role in ensuring the safe operation of the system. Failure of the power supply stages can lead to system failure, which can have safety implications. Therefore, the power supply stages are designed with safety in mind, and their operation is monitored and controlled to ensure safe operation.

In addition to their role in the overall system architecture, the power supply stages are also related to other components of the system, such as the input stages (Section 4.2), which provide input signals to the power supply stages. The power supply stages are also connected to the memory protection unit (Section 4.3.4), which ensures the integrity of the system's memory.

In summary, the different types of power supply stages are essential components of the overall system architecture, and their operation is critical to ensuring the safe and reliable operation of the system."

Question:  How do the failure diagnostics and reaction mechanisms work together to ensure system safety in the event of an error or fault?","The failure diagnostics and reaction mechanisms in the system work together to ensure system safety in the event of an error or fault by implementing a comprehensive safety concept. 

Firstly, the failure diagnostics, as described in [table_7.png] and [table_8.png], are responsible for detecting errors or faults in the system. This includes monitoring the system's components, such as the power supply, input stages, and safety-critical system components, to identify any malfunctions or anomalies. 

Once an error or fault is detected, the reaction mechanisms are triggered to respond accordingly. The reaction mechanisms, as outlined in [table_7.png] and [table_8.png], include failure reaction in case of errors, failure reaction time, and safety function. 

The failure reaction in case of errors involves taking corrective action to prevent the system from entering an unsafe state. This may include shutting down the system, isolating the faulty component, or initiating a safe state. The failure reaction time is critical in ensuring that the system responds quickly to errors, minimizing the risk of damage or harm. 

The safety function, as defined in [table_7.png], is responsible for ensuring that the system operates within a safe state. This includes defining the safe state, identifying safety-critical system components, and implementing safety mechanisms to prevent the system from entering an unsafe state. 

In addition to these mechanisms, the system also incorporates safety information, as outlined in [table_7.png], which provides guidelines and recommendations for ensuring system safety. This includes safety lifecycle, IEC 61508, ISO 13849, and ISO 25119, which provide a framework for designing and implementing safety-critical systems. 

In summary, the failure diagnostics and reaction mechanisms work together to ensure system safety by detecting errors or faults, responding quickly to prevent the system from entering an unsafe state, and implementing safety mechanisms to ensure the system operates within a safe state."

## 2 Safety Lifecycle - - -

Category: Comment ID: 586714 Due to the HY-TTC 500 platform's nature of being a generic control unit for diverse safety-critical applications, the execution of the IEC 61508, ISO 13849 and ISO 25119 safety lifecycle phases are based on specific assumptions for the overall system. These assumptions are listed within the following document and need to be considered by the system integrator. <chunk_seperator> Category: Comment ID: 3074044 The following subsections list the corresponding safety lifecycle phases and/or activities partly (e.g. 

overall system phases only applied on ECU level, ...) or completely considered in the course of the HYTTC 500 platform development. Caused by the platforms nature, only a subset of phases/activities have been applied to the HY-TTC 500 which means all other lifecycle phases/activities have to be considered in the course of the system development by the system integrator. Although a phase/activity has already been considered on HY-TTC 500 ECU level, it does not mean that it is not also relevant for the system integrator on system level.

## 2.1 Iec 61508

Category: Comment ID: 729253 The following IEC 61508 safety lifecycle phases were conducted on ECU level during the development of the HY‑TTC 500 platform. The system integrator is, however, required to evaluate those assumptions that have been made during the execution:

## 2.2 Iso 13849 <chunk_seperator> - ISO 25119 AgPL d/SRL 2.

The HY-TTC 500 platform may also fulfill the requirements of the ISO 26262 series of standards, however this Safety Manual alone does NOT cover all necessary requirements to use the platform in an ISO 26262 related environment. If the platform will be used in an ISO 26262 related environment the customer needs to fulfil the requirements in this Safety Manual and the ISO 26262 Safety Manual 
[TTC500-SM-26262] addon.

Category: Comment ID: 4572941 The HY-TTC 500 platform allows the system integrator to realize mixed criticality applications (applications containing safe and unsafe code).

Therefore, mechanisms for temporal and spatial separation have been considered during development. Temporal separation is already ensured by design, but spatial separation needs to be implemented by the application software (see section '*Memory Protection Unit*'). <chunk_seperator> For the documentation of the I/O drivers, including information on how to use these drivers in safety related applications, refer to the HY-TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM], Part II: Software Description. Check the release notes for known issues and their impact on the ECU's functions.

The HY-TTC 500 platform cannot guarantee safe operation of the system as a whole. Therefore, certain requirements and constraints have to be fulfilled by the application software as described in this document. Also, a functional safety assessment has to be conducted for the final system according to the system's applicable standards and norms.

Category: Comment ID: 586702 The HY-TTC 500 platform fulfills the requirements of the following safety standards and their assigned safety/performance levels:
- ISO 13849 Category 2, Performance Level d. - IEC 61508 Safety Integrity Level 2.

- ISO 25119 AgPL d/SRL 2.

Category: Comment ID: 586714 Due to the HY-TTC 500 platform's nature of being a generic control unit for diverse safety-critical applications, the execution of the IEC 61508, ISO 13849 and ISO 25119 safety lifecycle phases are based on specific assumptions for the overall system. These assumptions are listed within the following document and need to be considered by the system integrator. <chunk_seperator> Category: Comment ID: 3074044 The following subsections list the corresponding safety lifecycle phases and/or activities partly (e.g. 

overall system phases only applied on ECU level, ...) or completely considered in the course of the HYTTC 500 platform development. Caused by the platforms nature, only a subset of phases/activities have been applied to the HY-TTC 500 which means all other lifecycle phases/activities have to be considered in the course of the system development by the system integrator. Although a phase/activity has already been considered on HY-TTC 500 ECU level, it does not mean that it is not also relevant for the system integrator on system level.

## 2.1 Iec 61508

Category: Comment ID: 729253 The following IEC 61508 safety lifecycle phases were conducted on ECU level during the development of the HY‑TTC 500 platform. The system integrator is, however, required to evaluate those assumptions that have been made during the execution:

The HY-TTC 500 platform may also fulfill the requirements of the ISO 26262 series of standards, however this Safety Manual alone does NOT cover all necessary requirements to use the platform in an ISO 26262 related environment. If the platform will be used in an ISO 26262 related environment the customer needs to fulfil the requirements in this Safety Manual and the ISO 26262 Safety Manual 
[TTC500-SM-26262] addon.

Category: Comment ID: 4572941 The HY-TTC 500 platform allows the system integrator to realize mixed criticality applications (applications containing safe and unsafe code).

Therefore, mechanisms for temporal and spatial separation have been considered during development. Temporal separation is already ensured by design, but spatial separation needs to be implemented by the application software (see section '*Memory Protection Unit*'). <chunk_seperator> For the documentation of the I/O drivers, including information on how to use these drivers in safety related applications, refer to the HY-TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM], Part II: Software Description. Check the release notes for known issues and their impact on the ECU's functions.

The HY-TTC 500 platform cannot guarantee safe operation of the system as a whole. Therefore, certain requirements and constraints have to be fulfilled by the application software as described in this document. Also, a functional safety assessment has to be conducted for the final system according to the system's applicable standards and norms.

Category: Comment ID: 586702 The HY-TTC 500 platform fulfills the requirements of the following safety standards and their assigned safety/performance levels:

As explained in chapter *4.2 Hardware* properties, **the topology of CAN is the Bus. This means, the CAN has a direct connection line, which reaches from the first to the last participant.** 
Each individual participant is directly connected to the signal lines CAN-H and CAN-L. At both ends of the main bus (the longest direct connection line) the bus line has to be terminated using a resistance of 120 Ohm. 

For the length of the main bus as well as for the length of the individual stub cable between the bus and the network participants, the maximum line lengths, described in chapter *4.2.5* Transmission **speed, should be strictly adhered to.** 

![59_image_1.png]( The image shows a diagram of an electrical system with multiple lines and connections. There are several busbars labeled ""busline"" that connect different parts of the system.

Question:  Why are the ECU's sensor supply outputs not automatically switched off when entering the safe state?","The ECU's sensor supply outputs are not automatically switched off when entering the safe state because, for diagnostic reasons, the sensor supply outputs should not be immediately switched off in case of a failure or malfunction. This is to prevent introducing dangerous situations in reduced operation mode.

In a safety-critical system, it is essential to ensure that the system can operate safely even in the event of a failure or malfunction. To achieve this, the system integrator should implement a limp-home function, which allows the system to run in a reduced mode in case of a failure, rather than switching off immediately. This approach helps to prevent hazardous conditions and ensures the system can be safely shut down or repaired.

In the context of the HY-TTC 500 system, the sensor supply outputs are not automatically switched off when entering the safe state to allow the system integrator to implement a limp-home function. This function enables the system to run in a reduced mode in case of a failure, rather than switching off immediately, thereby preventing hazardous conditions and ensuring the system can be safely shut down or repaired.

The HY-TTC 500 system's safety-critical components, such as the main CPU, safety companion, power supply, and internal temperature monitoring, are designed to ensure safe operation even in the event of a failure or malfunction. These components are allocated to separate shut-off groups, each featuring distinct shut-off paths, to prevent dangerous situations in reduced operation mode.

In summary, the ECU's sensor supply outputs are not automatically switched off when entering the safe state to enable the system integrator to implement a limp-home function, which allows the system to run in a reduced mode in case of a failure, rather than switching off immediately, thereby preventing hazardous conditions and ensuring the system can be safely shut down or repaired."

Question:  How can the system integrator implement a limp-home function in case of certain failures on the HY-TTC 500 platform?","To implement a limp-home function in case of certain failures on the HY-TTC 500 platform, the system integrator can allocate the actuators to separate shut-off groups, each featuring distinct shut-off paths. This is possible because the HY-TTC 500 platform's PWM stages are allocated to three different shut-off groups (as mentioned in Comment ID: 590202). 

In the event of certain failures, the application software can de-energize the group with the erroneous PWM output while keeping the remaining two groups operational. This allows the system integrator to implement a limp-home function, enabling the system to run in a reduced mode, for instance, when returning to the workshop for repair. 

To ensure safe operation, the system integrator must allocate the actuators to the groups in a way that does not introduce hazardous situations in reduced operation mode (as required by Shutoff_Allocation, ID: 590192). 

Additionally, the system integrator should ensure that the necessary diagnostic measures are in place to detect failures within the safety-critical components. This can be achieved by utilizing the HY-TTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules, which can detect dangerous failures within these functional blocks (as mentioned in Comment ID: 590200)."

When selecting the application software's glitch filter time, the system integrator should account for all those failures that may occur only temporary. For example, a low battery voltage situation caused by cold-start cranking may lead to an invalid sensor supply voltage. However, only violations that do last longer than the specified glitch filter time will signal a persistent error. For details, refer to section *Failure* Reaction in Case of *Errors.*

The system integrator **shall** consider the HY-TTC 500 platform's effective failure reaction time for each safety function.

Category: Comment ID: 813084 For calculating the worst case failure reaction time, the system integrator has to combine the core diagnostic's failure reaction time (being independent from the used I/Os) and the additional I/O related failure reaction time (taking into account the I/O specific diagnostic time delay). That way, the overall failure reaction time can be determined accurately, for each individual safety function.

Category: Comment ID: 813423 Specific properties of the input and output stages (and their related signals) might contribute to the overall worst case failure reaction time for a given safety function, as well.

For the overall worst case failure reaction time, the system integrator typically has to add up the worst case failure reaction times of the core and the worst case failure reaction time for the input and output stages (i.e. the single input or output stage type that has the greatest influence). <chunk_seperator> ____________________________________________

## Remarque <chunk_seperator> ## - 3.1.5.1 Core Failure Reaction Time - -

Category: Comment ID: 813067 The effective reaction time of the core's diagnostics is based on the following parameters that can be adjusted during the I/O driver initialization call:
- Command period, i.e. the so-called cycle time (*t_cycle*): 1 … 50 ms
- Glitch filter time (*t_glitch*): 1 … 180 ms In addition, the external watchdog window time (*t_wd*) is defined to be 64 ms.

The configured glitch filter time correlates with the selected cycle time. Each specific failure diagnostic will be executed every sixth application cycle. Under worst case conditions, the applied glitch filter time will therefore increase to the next higher integer multiple of 6 * t_cycle.

## Remarque <chunk_seperator> ## - 3.1.5.1 Core Failure Reaction Time - -

Category: Comment ID: 813067 The effective reaction time of the core's diagnostics is based on the following parameters that can be adjusted during the I/O driver initialization call:
- Command period, i.e. the so-called cycle time (*t_cycle*): 1 … 50 ms
- Glitch filter time (*t_glitch*): 1 … 180 ms In addition, the external watchdog window time (*t_wd*) is defined to be 64 ms.

The configured glitch filter time correlates with the selected cycle time. Each specific failure diagnostic will be executed every sixth application cycle. Under worst case conditions, the applied glitch filter time will therefore increase to the next higher integer multiple of 6 * t_cycle.
Question:  How often is an individual diagnostic measure performed, and what triggers this performance?",An individual diagnostic measure is performed every 6 application cycles. This is triggered by the call to IO_Driver_TaskEnd().

When selecting the application software's glitch filter time, the system integrator should account for all those failures that may occur only temporary. For example, a low battery voltage situation caused by cold-start cranking may lead to an invalid sensor supply voltage. However, only violations that do last longer than the specified glitch filter time will signal a persistent error. For details, refer to section *Failure* Reaction in Case of *Errors.*

## 3.1.5.2 I/O Failure Reaction Time

Category: Comment ID: 813423 Specific properties of the input and output stages (and their related signals) might contribute to the overall worst case failure reaction time for a given safety function, as well.

For the overall worst case failure reaction time, the system integrator typically has to add up the worst case failure reaction times of the core and the worst case failure reaction time for the input and output stages (i.e. the single input or output stage type that has the greatest influence). <chunk_seperator> ____________________________________________

## Remarque <chunk_seperator> ## - 3.1.5.1 Core Failure Reaction Time - -

Category: Comment ID: 813067 The effective reaction time of the core's diagnostics is based on the following parameters that can be adjusted during the I/O driver initialization call:
- Command period, i.e. the so-called cycle time (*t_cycle*): 1 … 50 ms
- Glitch filter time (*t_glitch*): 1 … 180 ms In addition, the external watchdog window time (*t_wd*) is defined to be 64 ms.

The configured glitch filter time correlates with the selected cycle time. Each specific failure diagnostic will be executed every sixth application cycle. Under worst case conditions, the applied glitch filter time will therefore increase to the next higher integer multiple of 6 * t_cycle.
Question:  How is the overall worst case failure reaction time calculated for a given safety function, considering both the core and I/O failure reaction times?","The overall worst case failure reaction time for a given safety function is calculated by combining the core diagnostic's failure reaction time and the additional I/O related failure reaction time. This is done by considering the worst case failure reaction times of both the core and the I/O stages.

The core's effective worst case failure reaction time (wc_frt_core) is calculated based on the following parameters: command period (t_cycle), glitch filter time (t_glitch), and external watchdog window time (t_wd). The calculation is as follows: wc_frt_core = max(((6+1) * t_cycle) + t_glitch_effective, t_wd), where t_glitch_effective = round_to_multiple(t_glitch, 6*t_cycle).

The I/O failure reaction time is dependent on the specific properties of the input and output stages and their related signals. The system integrator needs to add up the worst case failure reaction times of the core and the I/O stages to get the overall worst case failure reaction time for a given safety function.

The overall worst case failure reaction time can be calculated as follows: wc_frt_overall = max(wc_frt_core, wc_frt_io), where wc_frt_io is the worst case failure reaction time for the I/O stages.

In summary, the system integrator should consider both the core and I/O failure reaction times to accurately determine the overall worst case failure reaction time for each individual safety function. This is crucial to ensure the safe operation of the system, as it directly affects the failure reaction time in case of errors."

Category: Comment ID: 719711 The following examples will outline the procedure for calculating the worst case failure reaction time for given sets of inputs and outputs together with assumed cycle time (*t_cycle*) and glitch filter time (*t_glitch*).

## Category: Comment Id: 813591 Example 1: <chunk_seperator> An application software specifies the cycle time (*t_cycle*) to be 10 ms and the glitch filter time (*t_glitch*) to be 100 ms. A given safety function makes use of the following safety-related inputs and outputs: 
- 3 PWM high side outputs configured with an output frequency of 250 Hz 
- 2 digital high side outputs - 2 timer inputs being used with a frequency of 2 kHz, each 
- 2 timer inputs being used with a frequency of 100 Hz, each The resulting worst case failure reaction time of the core can be calculated as follows: <chunk_seperator> Therefore, they do feature a failure reaction time of 0 ms.

wc_frt_io = 0 ms

## 3.1.5.2.5 External Shut-Off Inputs

Category: Comment ID: 969439 The worst case reaction time for shutting off the corresponding safety switch groups via the external shutoff inputs is only dependent on the particular application cycle time. These analog shut-off inputs are sampled every 6th application cycle and the shut-off groups will be deactivated within the next application cycle or within 5 ms - whichever occurs first. wc_frt_extshutoff = (6 * t_cycle) + min(t_cycle; 5 ms)
Note: This formula assumes an ideal switch without bouncing and simultaneous switching times for both terminals. Depending on the chosen switch, further timing delays have to be considered.

## - 3.1.5.3 Calculation Examples - <chunk_seperator> wc_frt_io_timer2kHz = 0.5 ms The additional failure reaction time caused by the 2 timer inputs with a frequency of 100 Hz is:
wc_frt_io_timer100Hz = 10 ms For the overall worst case calculation, the I/O type with the greatest influence, i.e. the digital high side outputs, will be used: wc_frt_io = wc_frt_io_dout = *20 ms* The overall failure reaction time for this exemplary configuration of the HY-TTC 500 platform is therefore:
wc_frt = wc_frt_core + wc_frt_io = 190 ms + 20 ms = 210 ms That means, the assumed diagnostic coverage for the I/O driver's core diagnostics is only valid for safety functions with a process safety time of 210 ms or higher. For those safety functions that require a shorter failure reaction time, the system integrator needs to either adapt the above-mentioned parameters or provide separate diagnostic measures within the application software.
Question:  How is the configured PWM frequency related to the worst case failure reaction time in PWM high side outputs?","The configured PWM frequency is directly related to the worst case failure reaction time in PWM high side outputs. The effective increase of the core's failure reaction time is twice the PWM output period plus an additional application cycle, which can be represented by the formula: wc_frt_io = 2 * pwm_period + t_cycle. This means that the higher the PWM frequency, the shorter the PWM output period, and consequently, the shorter the worst case failure reaction time."

Category: Comment ID: 719711 The following examples will outline the procedure for calculating the worst case failure reaction time for given sets of inputs and outputs together with assumed cycle time (*t_cycle*) and glitch filter time (*t_glitch*).

## Category: Comment Id: 813591 Example 1: <chunk_seperator> An application software specifies the cycle time (*t_cycle*) to be 10 ms and the glitch filter time (*t_glitch*) to be 100 ms. A given safety function makes use of the following safety-related inputs and outputs: 
- 3 PWM high side outputs configured with an output frequency of 250 Hz 
- 2 digital high side outputs - 2 timer inputs being used with a frequency of 2 kHz, each 
- 2 timer inputs being used with a frequency of 100 Hz, each The resulting worst case failure reaction time of the core can be calculated as follows: <chunk_seperator> Therefore, they do feature a failure reaction time of 0 ms.

## 3.1.5.2.5 External Shut-Off Inputs

Category: Comment ID: 969439 The worst case reaction time for shutting off the corresponding safety switch groups via the external shutoff inputs is only dependent on the particular application cycle time. These analog shut-off inputs are sampled every 6th application cycle and the shut-off groups will be deactivated within the next application cycle or within 5 ms - whichever occurs first. wc_frt_extshutoff = (6 * t_cycle) + min(t_cycle; 5 ms)
Note: This formula assumes an ideal switch without bouncing and simultaneous switching times for both terminals. Depending on the chosen switch, further timing delays have to be considered.

## - 3.1.5.3 Calculation Examples - <chunk_seperator> wc_frt_io_timer2kHz = 0.5 ms The additional failure reaction time caused by the 2 timer inputs with a frequency of 100 Hz is:
wc_frt_io_timer100Hz = 10 ms For the overall worst case calculation, the I/O type with the greatest influence, i.e. the digital high side outputs, will be used: wc_frt_io = wc_frt_io_dout = *20 ms* The overall failure reaction time for this exemplary configuration of the HY-TTC 500 platform is therefore:
wc_frt = wc_frt_core + wc_frt_io = 190 ms + 20 ms = 210 ms That means, the assumed diagnostic coverage for the I/O driver's core diagnostics is only valid for safety functions with a process safety time of 210 ms or higher. For those safety functions that require a shorter failure reaction time, the system integrator needs to either adapt the above-mentioned parameters or provide separate diagnostic measures within the application software.
Question:  How does the digital high side output increase the core's failure reaction time?","According to the provided information, the digital high side output increases the core's failure reaction time by 20 ms. This is stated in the section 3.1.5.2.2 Digital High Side Outputs, where it is mentioned that ""The digital high side output increases the core's failure reaction time by 20 ms. wc_frt_io = 20 ms"". This means that the digital high side output adds a fixed delay of 20 ms to the core's failure reaction time, which can impact the overall worst-case failure reaction time of the system."

- The second mission profile (*MP_Stop-Go*) considers the common usage characteristics of stop-&-go applications, with a high number of very short working tasks throughout the typical working day: o Number of working cycles per day: 100 o Average temperature variation seen by the ECU's components each working cycle: 5 °C o Average temperature variation seen by the ECU's components each non-operational day: 10 °C

Both mission profiles are based on the worst-case assumption of 24 h of operational time per day and an average operational utilization of 300 days per year. In addition, the following ambient temperature distribution has been assumed:

Category: Comment ID: 591167 The hardware failure rate estimation has been performed based on two different assumed environmental conditions, in order to allow the system integrator to choose the mission profile that fits best to the overall system's mission profile. The both mission profiles differ in their typical usage characteristics: - The first mission profile (*MP_Conventional*) is targeted towards conventional off-highway vehicles, typically being operated continuously throughout the whole day with a relatively low number of operational cycles: o Number of working cycles per day: 5 o Average temperature variation seen by the ECU's components each working cycle: 35 °C o Average temperature variation seen by the ECU's components each non-operational day: 10 °C

- <chunk_seperator> wc_frt_core = max(((6+1) * 1 ms) + 180 ms, 64 ms) = 187 ms The additional failure reaction time caused by the PWM high side outputs is: wc_frt_io_pwm = 2 * 2 ms + 1 ms = 5 ms The additional failure reaction time caused by the PWM high side current measurement is:
wc_frt_io_current = 20 ms + 1 ms = 21 ms The additional failure reaction time caused by the 2 timer inputs with a frequency of 10 Hz is: wc_frt_io_timer = 100 ms The 4 analog inputs do not contribute to the overall failure rate, at all. wc_frt_io_analog = 0 ms For the overall worst case calculation, the I/O type with the greatest influence, i.e. the timer inputs, will be used: <chunk_seperator> wc_frt_io = wc_frt_io_timer = 100 ms The overall failure reaction time for this exemplary configuration of the HY-TTC 500 platform is therefore: wc_frt = wc_frt_core + wc_frt_io = 187 ms + 100 ms = 287 ms That means, the assumed diagnostic coverage for the I/O driver's core diagnostics is only valid for safety functions with a process safety time of 287 ms or higher. For those safety functions that require a shorter failure reaction time, the system integrator needs to either adapt the above-mentioned parameters or provide separate diagnostic measures within the application software. <chunk_seperator> Category: Comment ID: 813743

## Example 2: -

An application software specifies the cycle time (*t_cycle*) to be 1 ms and the glitch filter time (*t_glitch*) to be 180 ms. A given safety function makes use of the following safety-related inputs and outputs: 
- 2 PWM high side outputs configured with an output frequency of 500 Hz and safety-relevant current measurement
- 2 timer inputs being used with a frequency of 10 Hz, each 
- 4 analog inputs The resulting worst case failure reaction time of the core can be calculated as follows: t_glitch_effective = round_to_multiple(180 ms, 6*1 ms) = 180 ms Note: *round_to_multiple* means to find a positive integer number n that fulfills *n*6*t_cycle >= t_glitch*. In this example n must be 30 which results in *30*6*10ms = 180ms*. <chunk_seperator> In addition to the main components, there are three more smaller objects in the scene: two located near the top left corner and another one towards the bottom right corner.

## Example 2: -

An application software specifies the cycle time (*t_cycle*) to be 1 ms and the glitch filter time (*t_glitch*) to be 180 ms. A given safety function makes use of the following safety-related inputs and outputs: 
- 2 PWM high side outputs configured with an output frequency of 500 Hz and safety-relevant current measurement
- 2 timer inputs being used with a frequency of 10 Hz, each 
- 4 analog inputs The resulting worst case failure reaction time of the core can be calculated as follows: t_glitch_effective = round_to_multiple(180 ms, 6*1 ms) = 180 ms Note: *round_to_multiple* means to find a positive integer number n that fulfills *n*6*t_cycle >= t_glitch*. In this example n must be 30 which results in *30*6*10ms = 180ms*. <chunk_seperator> In addition to the main components, there are three more smaller objects in the scene: two located near the top left corner and another one towards the bottom right corner.

![34_image_1.png]( The image displays a diagram of an electrical circuit with a red sign stating ""INVALID"" placed over it. The circuit appears to be a complex network of wires and components, including batteries, switches, and other electronic devices. The presence of the ""INVALID"" sign suggests that this particular circuit is not functioning correctly or has been deemed unsafe for use.)

The following figure shows another **invalid** wiring example when using a power switch to concurrently disconnect terminal 15 and the supply for the internal power stages (BAT+ Power). In case of external short circuits in the actuator lines, the terminal 15 input might still be supplied via reverse conducting power stages, even if the power switch is activated.

## Figure 2 <chunk_seperator> Category: Comment ID: 591645 The HY-TTC 500 platform features two physically separated power supply connections. One power supply connection is exclusively provided for the ECU's logic unit, while the other connection supplies the power stages. In addition, the ECU is equipped with two additional inputs for a power control function: In permanently supplied systems, the terminal 15 input (K15) may be connected with the ignition key lock, the wake up input (Wake-Up) may be connected to a secondary power up source (e.g. the vehicle's door contact). The ECU's activation is triggered, in case one of these inputs is turned on.

The following figure shows another **invalid** wiring example when using a power switch to concurrently disconnect terminal 15 and the supply for the internal power stages (BAT+ Power). In case of external short circuits in the actuator lines, the terminal 15 input might still be supplied via reverse conducting power stages, even if the power switch is activated.

## Figure 2 <chunk_seperator> Category: Comment ID: 591645 The HY-TTC 500 platform features two physically separated power supply connections. One power supply connection is exclusively provided for the ECU's logic unit, while the other connection supplies the power stages. In addition, the ECU is equipped with two additional inputs for a power control function: In permanently supplied systems, the terminal 15 input (K15) may be connected with the ignition key lock, the wake up input (Wake-Up) may be connected to a secondary power up source (e.g. the vehicle's door contact). The ECU's activation is triggered, in case one of these inputs is turned on. After deactivating these signals, the ECU may continue to operate before autonomously powering down upon the application's shutdown request.

Question:  What are the two additional inputs on the ECU used for, and how do they trigger the ECU's activation?","The two additional inputs on the ECU (Electronic Control Unit) are the terminal 15 input (K15) and the wake-up input. These inputs are used for power control functions.

The terminal 15 input (K15) can be connected to the ignition key lock, which means that when the ignition key is turned, the ECU is activated. This input can also be connected to a secondary power-up source, such as the vehicle's door contact.

The wake-up input, on the other hand, can be connected to a secondary power-up source, allowing the ECU to be activated even when the main power supply is turned off.

When either of these inputs is turned on, the ECU's activation is triggered. This means that the ECU will start operating and performing its intended functions. Even after these signals are deactivated, the ECU may continue to operate autonomously before powering down upon the application's shutdown request.

In summary, the two additional inputs on the ECU, terminal 15 and wake-up, are used to trigger the ECU's activation, allowing it to start operating and performing its functions."

The circuit appears to be a complex network of wires and components, including batteries, switches, and other electronic devices. The presence of the ""INVALID"" sign suggests that this particular circuit is not functioning correctly or has been deemed unsafe for use.)

The following figure shows another **invalid** wiring example when using a power switch to concurrently disconnect terminal 15 and the supply for the internal power stages (BAT+ Power). In case of external short circuits in the actuator lines, the terminal 15 input might still be supplied via reverse conducting power stages, even if the power switch is activated.

## Figure 2 <chunk_seperator> Category: Comment ID: 591645 The HY-TTC 500 platform features two physically separated power supply connections. One power supply connection is exclusively provided for the ECU's logic unit, while the other connection supplies the power stages. In addition, the ECU is equipped with two additional inputs for a power control function: In permanently supplied systems, the terminal 15 input (K15) may be connected with the ignition key lock, the wake up input (Wake-Up) may be connected to a secondary power up source (e.g. the vehicle's door contact). The ECU's activation is triggered, in case one of these inputs is turned on. After deactivating these signals, the ECU may continue to operate before autonomously powering down upon the application's shutdown request. Details about the terminal 15 and wake up inputs can be found in the TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM]. In case the software-controlled shutdown function via terminal 15 is not utilized (i.e., terminal 15 is tied to battery
Question:  What is the problem with the invalid wiring examples shown in the figures, and how do they affect the ECU's operation?","The problem with the invalid wiring examples shown in the figures is that they do not provide a reliable shutdown mechanism for the ECU's logic core in case of external short circuits on the actuator lines.

In the first invalid wiring example [34_image_0.png], the power switch is connected to the power supply rails, but it does not disconnect the terminal 15 input from the power stages. This means that even if the power switch is activated, the terminal 15 input can still be supplied via the reverse conducting power stages, which can prevent the ECU from shutting down properly.

In the second invalid wiring example [34_image_1.png], the power switch is connected to the terminal 15 input and the supply for the internal power stages, but it does not decouple the power supply rails from each other. This means that if there is an external short circuit on the actuator lines, the power switch may not be able to de-energize the ECU's logic core, which can prevent the ECU from shutting down properly.

These invalid wiring examples can affect the ECU's operation in several ways. Firstly, they can prevent the ECU from shutting down properly in case of an external short circuit, which can lead to unpredictable behavior or even damage to the system. Secondly, they can cause the ECU to continue operating even when the power switch is activated, which can lead to power consumption and heat generation issues. Finally, they can make it difficult to implement a software-controlled shutdown mechanism, which is an important safety feature in many systems.

In contrast, the valid wiring example [35_image_0.png] shows a power switch that independently disconnects the supply for the internal logic core (BAT+ CPU) and also decouples both power supply rails from each other. This ensures that the ECU's logic core can be reliably shut down in case of an external short circuit, and that the power switch can de-energize the ECU's logic core even if there is an external short circuit on the actuator lines."

In these cases, the terminal 15 input might still be supplied via reverse conducting power stages, even if the power switch is activated, which could lead to unintended operation or malfunction of the ECU.

By using a power switch that independently disconnects the supply for the internal logic core, the system integrator can ensure that the ECU's logic unit is reliably disconnected from the power stage supply rail, even in the presence of external short circuits. This provides an additional layer of safety and reliability to the system, which is essential in critical applications where the ECU is responsible for controlling vital functions.

Furthermore, this configuration allows for a more controlled shutdown of the ECU, which is important in systems where a software-controlled after-run is not possible. By independently disconnecting the supply for the internal logic core, the power switch can ensure a clean shutdown of the ECU, which is essential for maintaining system integrity and preventing damage to the system or its components.

In summary, the advantage of using a power switch that independently disconnects the supply for the internal logic core is that it provides a reliable and safe shutdown of the ECU, even in the presence of external short circuits, and ensures a controlled and clean shutdown of the system."

Category: Comment ID: 592223 The analog 3 mode inputs (*IO_ADC_00* ... *IO_ADC_07*) can be configured by software for the following modes that may be used for safety-critical applications:
- Voltage measurement (0…5 V)
- Current measurement (0…24 mA) The HY-TTC 500 platform does not provide diagnostic measures for the following 3 mode setting.

- Resistance measurement (0…100 kOhm)
If a specific diagnostic coverage is required for usage within safety-critical applications, the system integrator has to provide means to detect failures within these input stages.

Category: Comment ID: 592233 The analog 3 mode inputs do provide the necessary measures for allowing single inputs to be used as safety-critical, when configured for voltage or current measurement. Thus, safety-critical analog sensors may be connected to analog 3 mode inputs in a single channel architecture, for those measurement modes. <chunk_seperator> ## 7.15.2.153 #Define Io_Di_75 Io_Pin_176

Category: Comment ID: 592223 The analog 3 mode inputs (*IO_ADC_00* ... *IO_ADC_07*) can be configured by software for the following modes that may be used for safety-critical applications:
- Voltage measurement (0…5 V)

As a result, the minimum and maximum duty cycles are limited, so that a test pulse for diagnostic measurements is present under all conditions which can be used for continuously testing the ability to deactivate the power stages.

The duty cycle limits and duty cycle tolerances are defined in the I/O driver. Depending on the initial I/O driver configuration, the HY-TTC 500 will either directly enter the safe state or leave the decision to the application software via the optional error callback (see section *Application Callbacks*).

The system integrator **shall** ensure that the PWM stage's lower duty cycle limit (i.e. the minimum possible duty cycle) does not already energize the connected actuator in a way that could lead to a dangerous situation.

Category: Comment ID: 919117 The minimum possible duty cycle results from the minimum pulse length (100 µs) that is present even if the application software deactivates a safety-critical high side stage. Depending on the configured PWM frequency, the minimum duty cycle might go up to a value of 10 %, i.e. for a PWM frequency of 1000 Hz.

As a result, the minimum and maximum duty cycles are limited, so that a test pulse for diagnostic measurements is present under all conditions which can be used for continuously testing the ability to deactivate the power stages.

The duty cycle limits and duty cycle tolerances are defined in the I/O driver. Depending on the initial I/O driver configuration, the HY-TTC 500 will either directly enter the safe state or leave the decision to the application software via the optional error callback (see section *Application Callbacks*).
Question:  What is the purpose of the internal secondary shut-off path, also known as the safety switch, in every PWM high side stage?","The purpose of the internal secondary shut-off path, also known as the safety switch, in every PWM high side stage is to provide an additional layer of safety and reliability in safety-critical applications. This safety switch is a redundant mechanism that can be used to shut off the PWM high side stage in case of a failure or malfunction, thereby preventing potential hazards or dangerous situations.

The safety switch is allocated to a predefined group of PWM high side stages, and depending on the device variant, up to three separate safety switches are available. This means that if a short circuit to battery voltage occurs at a PWM high side output's connector pin, even if it's not being used for safety-critical applications, it could potentially affect the safety integrity of all remaining high side stages sharing the same safety switch. Therefore, the system integrator must evaluate the criticality of such failures when allocating the HY-TTC 500 platform's connector pins to the system's safety functions.

In summary, the internal secondary shut-off path, or safety switch, is a critical component of the PWM high side stages, providing an additional layer of safety and reliability in safety-critical applications by allowing for the shutdown of the PWM high side stage in case of a failure or malfunction."

## 4.12.6 Digital And Frequency Inputs

If a high-side output is not needed on IO_PWM_00 - IO_PWM_35, **the loop-back path of these** output stages can be alternatively used as a digital or frequency input. External switches which are directly switching to battery voltage must not be used with alternative inputs. See Section 6.6 on page 218 **for more information on using the alternative digital and frequency** input function of the High-Side PWM Outputs.

## 4.12.6.1 Characteristics Of Digital Input
Question:  What permissions does the I/O Driver code need if the Memory Protection Unit (MPU) is used?","If the Memory Protection Unit (MPU) is used, the I/O Driver code needs the following permissions:

1. Read and write permissions for the following RAM memory sections:
   - CSM_VAR_ZERO_INIT_UNSPECIFIED
   - CSM_VAR_NO_INIT_UNSPECIFIED
   - IO_DRIVER_DATA_NORMAL
   - IO_DRIVER_COMMON
   - Shared Memory area (0x0803FEE0 to 0x0803FFFF)

2. Read and executable permissions for the following internal flash memory sections:
   - CSM_CODE
   - IO_DRIVER_CODE
   - Exception vectors and the Bootloader memory area (0x0 to 0x0001FFFF)

3. At least read permissions for the following internal flash memory sections:
   - CSM_CONST
   - IO_DRIVER_CONST

Additionally, the I/O Driver code needs to fulfill the MPU access permissions requirements in both the main application thread and in exceptions. This includes enabling and disabling the user MPU regions using the IO_MPU functions as needed to comply with the I/O Driver requirements and the safety requirements specific to the application."

Motor braking is managed by switching on both high side power **stages simultaneously.**
Always switch off low side first before switching on high side. Never switch on high side while low side is still on. Please observe that the high side power stages can only measure current in positive direction (out of the terminal towards ground) While the high side power stages are actively braking, one power stage (this one that was operated before entering brake mode) shows a high current (close to start current) declining to 0 A, while the other is reverse operated and does not show any current at all. The brake sequence is considered to be finished when the brake **current falls below 1 A. By using** multiple power stages the limit is 1 A per power stage. A reverse motor run now can be started.

Motor braking is managed by switching on both high side power **stages simultaneously.**
Always switch off low side first before switching on high side. Never switch on high side while low side is still on. Please observe that the high side power stages can only measure current in positive direction (out of the terminal towards ground) While the high side power stages are actively braking, one power stage (this one that was operated before entering brake mode) shows a high current (close to start current) declining to 0 A, while the other is reverse operated and does not show any current at all. The brake sequence is considered to be finished when the brake **current falls below 1 A. By using** multiple power stages the limit is 1 A per power stage. A reverse motor run now can be started.

## 7.15.2.221 #Define Io_Do_47 Io_Pin_174 <chunk_seperator> The effective reaction time is based on the following parameters:
- The maximum cycle time (*t_cycle*) that is defined during the I/O driver initialization call
- The interval between the execution of the consistency check (*n_rounds_check*) in software cycles
- The external watchdog window time (*t_wd*) that is defined to be 64 ms. The calculation of the effective worst case failure reaction time is as follows: wc_frt = *max(t_cycle * (n_rounds_check + 1), t_wd)*
Compliance with the system's failure reaction time has been assumed during the HY-TTC 500 platform's FMEDA. Consequently, the effective diagnostic coverage for the relevant system components is only valid, if the application software's consistency checks are executed with an adequate frequency.

- The maximum cycle time (*t_cycle*) that is defined during the I/O driver initialization call
- The interval between the execution of the consistency check (*n_rounds_check*) in software cycles
- The external watchdog window time (*t_wd*) that is defined to be 64 ms. The calculation of the effective worst case failure reaction time is as follows: wc_frt = *max(t_cycle * (n_rounds_check + 1), t_wd)*
Compliance with the system's failure reaction time has been assumed during the HY-TTC 500 platform's FMEDA. Consequently, the effective diagnostic coverage for the relevant system components is only valid, if the application software's consistency checks are executed with an adequate frequency.

Question:  What measures should the system integrator take to check for stack overflows, as the HY-TTC 500 platform's safety measures do not provide this check?","To ensure the reliability and safety of the HY-TTC 500 platform, the system integrator should take measures to check for stack overflows. Since the platform's safety measures do not provide this check, the system integrator must implement additional measures to prevent stack overflows.

One possible approach is to perform periodic checks for a preset pattern at the end of the stack. This can be done by inserting a specific value or pattern at the end of the stack during initialization and then periodically checking if this value or pattern is still intact. If the value or pattern has been altered, it may indicate a stack overflow.

Another approach is to utilize the Memory Protection Unit (MPU) to prevent write access with a barrier at the end of the stack. This can be achieved by configuring the MPU to restrict write access to specific memory regions, including the stack area. By doing so, the system integrator can prevent stack overflows and ensure the integrity of the system.

Additionally, the system integrator should consider implementing other measures to detect and prevent stack overflows, such as monitoring the stack pointer, using stack canaries, or implementing a stack overflow detection mechanism in the application software.

It is essential to note that the system integrator must also ensure that the application software's consistency checks are executed with an adequate frequency to maintain the system's failure reaction time. This is crucial for the safety functions that require a shorter failure reaction time. The system integrator should adapt the parameters, such as the cycle time (t_cycle) and the interval between the execution of the consistency check (n_rounds_check), to meet the system's process safety time.

In conclusion, the system integrator should take a multi-faceted approach to ensure the reliability and safety of the HY-TTC 500 platform. This includes implementing measures to check for stack overflows, monitoring the stack, and adapting the application software's consistency checks to maintain the system's failure reaction time."

2. Using checksums or cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs) to detect bit-modification in RAM variables.
3. Incorporating error detection and correction mechanisms in the application software, such as assertions and error handlers.
4. Conducting thorough testing and validation of the application software to ensure it operates correctly and as intended.

- <chunk_seperator> ## 6.3 Inductive Loads 6.3.1 Inductive Loads At Pwm Outputs

Inductive loads in PWM operation generate current through the freewheeling diodes, but these diodes have, at the same current, a power dissipation that is **several times greater than the high-side** switches themselves. Therefore the duty cycle has a great influence on the power dissipation of the output devices. The duty cycle results from the relationship between coil resistance and supply voltage. A low resistance at a high supply voltage is the worst combination, because it **results in a low duty cycle and, thus, in** a long conduction time of the diodes.

## 6.3.2 Inductive Loads At Low Side Switches

For load inductivities >100 mH, either the current has to be lower or an external freewheeling diode or clamping device parallel to the coil has to be used. The clamping device has to clamp below 50 V. <chunk_seperator> Category: Requirement Label: Error_Callback_Timing ID: 590305 Related To: 626937 Related To':
The application software's error callback function **shall** not introduce any significant delay when deciding the action to take, i.e. the error callback function must only contain basic statements for deciding which action to take. An acceptable upper limit for the execution of the callback function is 1 ms. This assures that the device's failure reaction time is not increased by the implementation of the callback function.

Category: Comment ID: 590311 The notification callback has no such limitation as the safe state is activated before this callback is called. It is still recommended to keep the notification callback function short because most interrupts 
(depending on the error) are disabled during its execution. <chunk_seperator> Read data from the socket and process ARP requests. Note This function needs to be called periodically in order to handle the received ARP requests:

It may be sufficient to rely on the function blocks' MTTFd values, as outlined in section *MTTFd Values of Functional Blocks*. Either way, TTControl suggests to implement an appropriate set of failure diagnostics, regardless of the system's architectural demands, in order to achieve the best possible safety performance.

Category: Comment ID: 723615 The HY-TTC 500 I/O driver provides 2 application callbacks, which can be configured when calling the general driver initialization function *IO_Driver_Init()*.

The callbacks are executed depending on the error type before the safe state is entered:
- Error callback - executed for *non-fatal* errors - Notification callback - executed for *fatal* errors Category: Comment ID: 723687 Within the error callback function, the application software can decide which action shall be taken (e.g. disable a PWM shut-off group).

Within the notification callback function, the application software could notify other controllers (e.g. in a CAN network), that a fatal error occurred and, if configured, a reset of the ECU will take place.

- <chunk_seperator> ## 6.3 Inductive Loads 6.3.1 Inductive Loads At Pwm Outputs

Inductive loads in PWM operation generate current through the freewheeling diodes, but these diodes have, at the same current, a power dissipation that is **several times greater than the high-side** switches themselves. Therefore the duty cycle has a great influence on the power dissipation of the output devices. The duty cycle results from the relationship between coil resistance and supply voltage. A low resistance at a high supply voltage is the worst combination, because it **results in a low duty cycle and, thus, in** a long conduction time of the diodes.

## 6.3.2 Inductive Loads At Low Side Switches

For load inductivities >100 mH, either the current has to be lower or an external freewheeling diode or clamping device parallel to the coil has to be used. The clamping device has to clamp below 50 V. <chunk_seperator> Category: Requirement Label: Error_Callback_Timing ID: 590305 Related To: 626937 Related To':
The application software's error callback function **shall** not introduce any significant delay when deciding the action to take, i.e. the error callback function must only contain basic statements for deciding which action to take. An acceptable upper limit for the execution of the callback function is 1 ms. This assures that the device's failure reaction time is not increased by the implementation of the callback function.

Category: Comment ID: 590311 The notification callback has no such limitation as the safe state is activated before this callback is called. It is still recommended to keep the notification callback function short because most interrupts 
(depending on the error) are disabled during its execution. <chunk_seperator> Read data from the socket and process ARP requests. Note This function needs to be called periodically in order to handle the received ARP requests:
When an ARP requests is received, the function automatically sends the response. In this case, IO_E_UDP_ARP_RECEIVED **is returned.**

Returns IO_ErrorType Return values <chunk_seperator> Note: If the overall system architecture permits the usage of functional structures without diagnostic coverage (e.g. for a system with a category B architecture according to ISO 13849) the implementation of these failure diagnostics might not be required. It may be sufficient to rely on the function blocks' MTTFd values, as outlined in section *MTTFd Values of Functional Blocks*. Either way, TTControl suggests to implement an appropriate set of failure diagnostics, regardless of the system's architectural demands, in order to achieve the best possible safety performance.

Category: Comment ID: 723615 The HY-TTC 500 I/O driver provides 2 application callbacks, which can be configured when calling the general driver initialization function *IO_Driver_Init()*.

The callbacks are executed depending on the error type before the safe state is entered:
- Error callback - executed for *non-fatal* errors - Notification callback - executed for *fatal* errors Category: Comment ID: 723687 Within the error callback function, the application software can decide which action shall be taken (e.g. disable a PWM shut-off group).

Within the notification callback function, the application software could notify other controllers (e.g. in a CAN network), that a fatal error occurred and, if configured, a reset of the ECU will take place.

- <chunk_seperator> ## 6.3 Inductive Loads 6.3.1 Inductive Loads At Pwm Outputs

Inductive loads in PWM operation generate current through the freewheeling diodes, but these diodes have, at the same current, a power dissipation that is **several times greater than the high-side** switches themselves. Therefore the duty cycle has a great influence on the power dissipation of the output devices. The duty cycle results from the relationship between coil resistance and supply voltage. A low resistance at a high supply voltage is the worst combination, because it **results in a low duty cycle and, thus, in** a long conduction time of the diodes.

## 6.3.2 Inductive Loads At Low Side Switches

For load inductivities >100 mH, either the current has to be lower or an external freewheeling diode or clamping device parallel to the coil has to be used. The clamping device has to clamp below 50 V. <chunk_seperator> Category: Requirement Label: Error_Callback_Timing ID: 590305 Related To: 626937 Related To':
The application software's error callback function **shall** not introduce any significant delay when deciding the action to take, i.e. the error callback function must only contain basic statements for deciding which action to take. An acceptable upper limit for the execution of the callback function is 1 ms. This assures that the device's failure reaction time is not increased by the implementation of the callback function.

Category: Comment ID: 590311 The notification callback has no such limitation as the safe state is activated before this callback is called. It is still recommended to keep the notification callback function short because most interrupts 
(depending on the error) are disabled during its execution. <chunk_seperator> Read data from the socket and process ARP requests. Note This function needs to be called periodically in order to handle the received ARP requests:
When an ARP requests is received, the function automatically sends the response. In this case, IO_E_UDP_ARP_RECEIVED **is returned.**
Parameters

<table_218>[{'socket_id': 'handle of socket to be used for reception'}, {'-------------': '---------------------------------------------'}, {'out': 'port'}, {'buf': 'buffer for received data'}, {'out': 'len'}, {'maxlen': 'maximum size of receive buffer'}]</table_218>
Returns IO_ErrorType Return values <chunk_seperator> Note: If the overall system architecture permits the usage of functional structures without diagnostic coverage (e.g. for a system with a category B architecture according to ISO 13849) the implementation of these failure diagnostics might not be required. It may be sufficient to rely on the function blocks' MTTFd values, as outlined in section *MTTFd Values of Functional Blocks*. Either way, TTControl suggests to implement an appropriate set of failure diagnostics, regardless of the system's architectural demands, in order to achieve the best possible safety performance.

The application **shall** adequately debounce glitches originating from EMI or other disturbances for all safety-critical I/Os.

Question:  What is the acceptable upper limit for the execution of the error callback function in the application software?",The acceptable upper limit for the execution of the error callback function in the application software is 1 ms.

Question:  How many years does it take for the External RAM to reach 36 FIT, and what is its corresponding MTTFd?","According to the table, the External RAM has a failure rate of 3163 years for 36 FIT. 

To calculate the MTTFd (Mean Time To Failure in days), we can use the formula:

MTTFd = Failure Rate (in years) * 365 (days/year)

MTTFd = 3163 years * 365 days/year = 1,152,945 days

So, it takes approximately 3163 years for the External RAM to reach 36 FIT, and its corresponding MTTFd is 1,152,945 days."

Question:  What is the purpose of the item ""Core"" in the HY-TTC 500 platform, and why is its failure rate added to every individual safety function?","The purpose of the item ""Core"" in the HY-TTC 500 platform is to represent the integral logic components of the platform, which include the internal power supply and the main CPU. These components are vital to the Electronic Control Unit's (ECU's) general function. 

The failure rate of the ""Core"" is added to every individual safety function because its failure can affect the overall safety and functionality of the system. Since the ""Core"" is a critical component, its failure rate needs to be considered in the calculation of the overall failure rate of each safety function, regardless of the utilized set of functional blocks. This is to ensure that the system integrator takes into account the potential impact of the ""Core"" failure on the safety and reliability of the system."

The HY-TTC 500 uses the BAT+ CPU pin as a reference voltage input. The principle schematic is shown in Figure 49 **on the current page. The output is open loop controlled.

Category: Comment ID: 1534713 The following table covers all those functional blocks for which the HY-TTC 580 platform offers diagnostic measures to detect dangerous hardware failures. The corresponding diagnostic coverage for each component highly depends on the implemented diagnostic measures and needs to be estimated by the system integrator. A guideline on this selection can be found in section *Failure Diagnostics*.
Question:  What is the general approach in ISO 13849 regarding the distribution of failure rates between safe and dangerous failures?",The general approach in ISO 13849 regarding the distribution of failure rates between safe and dangerous failures is to identify the functional blocks that have a higher probability of failure. This is done by analyzing the diagnostic measures and the determination of their diagnostic coverage.

Parameters <chunk_seperator> ## 4.12.2.2 Mutual Exclusive Mode

The HY-TTC 500 uses double-channel high-side power stages. **For load leveling it is a benefit if** loads, which are switched on mutually exclusive (which means either load A, or load B is on, but not A and B at the same time), are connected to the same double-channel power stage. This reduces the thermal stress of the components. The power stage pairing is given in Section 4.12.1 on page **137.** For HS PWM output stage operating in 444–1000 Hz mode, the current limit is increased to 1 A if used in mutual exclusive mode, see Section 4.12.4.1 **on the next page.**

## 4.12.3 Maximum Ratings <chunk_seperator> Note: If the overall system architecture permits the usage of functional structures without diagnostic coverage (e.g. for a system with a category B architecture according to ISO 13849) the implementation of these failure diagnostics might not be required. It may be sufficient to rely on the function blocks' MTTFd values, as outlined in section *MTTFd Values of Functional Blocks*. Either way, TTControl suggests to implement an appropriate set of failure diagnostics, regardless of the system's architectural demands, in order to achieve the best possible safety performance.

Parameters <chunk_seperator> ## 4.12.2.2 Mutual Exclusive Mode

The HY-TTC 500 uses double-channel high-side power stages. **For load leveling it is a benefit if** loads, which are switched on mutually exclusive (which means either load A, or load B is on, but not A and B at the same time), are connected to the same double-channel power stage. This reduces the thermal stress of the components. The power stage pairing is given in Section 4.12.1 on page **137.** For HS PWM output stage operating in 444–1000 Hz mode, the current limit is increased to 1 A if used in mutual exclusive mode, see Section 4.12.4.1 **on the next page.**

## 4.12.3 Maximum Ratings <chunk_seperator> Note: If the overall system architecture permits the usage of functional structures without diagnostic coverage (e.g. for a system with a category B architecture according to ISO 13849) the implementation of these failure diagnostics might not be required. It may be sufficient to rely on the function blocks' MTTFd values, as outlined in section *MTTFd Values of Functional Blocks*. Either way, TTControl suggests to implement an appropriate set of failure diagnostics, regardless of the system's architectural demands, in order to achieve the best possible safety performance.

Question:  What is the effect of combining safety mechanisms that supplement each other in terms of their diagnostic capabilities?","The table provided shows the MTTFd values and FIT rates for various functional blocks in the HY-TTC 500 platform. The MTTFd values represent the mean time to failure in years, while the FIT rates represent the number of failures per billion hours of operation. 

For instance, the Extense Flash has an MTTFd value of 2361 years and a FIT rate of 48. This means that the Extense Flash is expected to fail 48 times per billion hours of operation, and its mean time to failure is 2361 years. 

Similarly, the Variable Sensor Supply IO_SENSOR_SUPPLY_2 has an MTTFd value of 1587 years and a FIT rate of 72. This means that the Variable Sensor Supply IO_SENSOR_SUPPLY_2 is expected to fail 72 times per billion hours of operation, and its mean time to failure is 1587 years. 

The other functional blocks, such as the Conventional, SW-define, per I/O, Ext. RAM, Ext. FRAM, High Side Digital / PVG / VOUT Output IO_PVG_00-IO_PVG_07, Timer Input 6-11, LIN Interface, RS232 Interface, CAN Interface 0-2, CAN Interface 3-6, CAN Termination, and Real Time Clock, also have their respective MTTFd values and FIT rates. 

These values can be used to determine the diagnostic coverage required for each functional block, depending on the system integrator's implementation on the system level. The selection of diagnostic measures requires considering the input elements' individual characteristics, such as possible signal ranges, failure modes, and architectural parameters."

## 5.7.3 Help For C Driver Functions

The I/O driver API documentation (**HY-TTC_500_IO_Driver_Manual_V3.1.0.chm** [4]) is available in the compiled HTML format and can be found in **Documentation > Manuals**. It provides a short overview of the available I/O driver functions as well as detailed descriptions of those functions, including parameters, return values and examples.

## 5.7.4 Linking Constant Data <chunk_seperator> ## 8.2.3 5 V Sensor Supplies

Category: Comment ID: 920236 The 5 V sensor supplies' correct functioning is implicitly checked by the HY-TTC 500 platform's I/O driver, if at least one safety-critical analog input is allocated to the corresponding sensor supply. To that end, the analog feedback signal is permanently checked for its voltage level and the I/O driver triggers an error callback in case of deviations. If there is no safety-critical analog input assigned to a specific 5 V sensor supply, but the overall system design requires diagnostic measures for the supply output, the application software can still read and evaluate the measured voltage level by calling the appropriate task function *IO_ADC_Get()* with the corresponding sensor supply parameter. <chunk_seperator> ![6_image_0.png]( The image features a yellow and black warning sign with an exclamation point on it. The sign is placed against a white background, making it stand out clearly. The design of the sign resembles a triangle shape, with a bold yellow border surrounding the black text. This cautionary sign likely indicates potential hazards or dangers in the area.)

The I/O driver's diagnostic modules will trigger an error callback in case of a detected failure.

## Resistive Input:

Due to restrictions in the resistance measurement mode, the reference channel cannot be used to directly monitor the correct function of the analog input stage. Therefore, no implicitly executed safety mechanisms can be claimed by the system integrator for defining the input stages' diagnostic coverage values. Consequently, additional measures have to be implemented in the application software, if the overall safety function requires diagnostic coverage for the analog input stages.

Question:  What is the purpose of the signal range check in the functional mode?","The purpose of the signal range check in the functional mode is to perform a plausibility check, which is an essential aspect of ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the system. This check is crucial in the I/O mode, as it verifies that the input signals are within the specified range, thereby preventing any potential errors or malfunctions that might occur due to out-of-range inputs.

In the context of the provided tables [table_32.png] and [table_33.png], the signal range check is an integral part of the system's functionality, particularly in the I/O mode. It is responsible for checking the input signals against a specified range, which is typically defined by the manufacturer or based on the system's design requirements.

The signal range check is closely related to the redundancy aspect, which is denoted by the ""2**"" symbol. This redundancy is essential for ensuring the system's reliability, especially in safety-critical applications. By incorporating redundancy, the system can continue to function correctly even in the event of a failure, thereby maintaining the overall safety and integrity of the system.

In summary, the signal range check in the functional mode serves as a crucial mechanism to ensure the system's reliability and accuracy by verifying that input signals are within the specified range, thereby preventing potential errors or malfunctions."

## Resistive Input:

Due to restrictions in the resistance measurement mode, the reference channel cannot be used to directly monitor the correct function of the analog input stage. Therefore, no implicitly executed safety mechanisms can be claimed by the system integrator for defining the input stages' diagnostic coverage values. Consequently, additional measures have to be implemented in the application software, if the overall safety function requires diagnostic coverage for the analog input stages.

Question:  What is the significance of the MTTFd values in the context of functional modes?","The significance of the MTTFd values in the context of functional modes is that they are equally valid for all functional modes. This means that the MTTFd values, which are specified in a dedicated table in section MTTFd Values of Functional Blocks, can be applied to all functional modes, including I/O, Driver Application, and others. This implies that the MTTFd values provide a common reference point for all functional modes, ensuring consistency and reliability in the system's operation.

In other words, the MTTFd values serve as a benchmark for the failure rates of different functional modes, allowing system integrators to assess the reliability and safety of their systems across various operating modes. This is particularly important in safety-critical applications, where the system's ability to operate reliably and safely is paramount.

It is also worth noting that the MTTFd values are specified in a dedicated table, which suggests that they are carefully calculated and validated to ensure their accuracy and relevance to the functional modes in question."

1. Connect the Lauterbach Base Station and Debug Cable to the PC and power supply and <chunk_seperator> Redundancy can also be claimed when combining two different input types (e.g. an analog input 3 mode with an analog input 2 mode for current measurement, or an analog 2 mode with a timer input for measuring digital signals), as long as the inputs' specifications both match the desired input signal).

This safety mechanism's diagnostic coverage is considered to lie between a value of **90-99** %, depending on the characteristics of the input elements (e.g. their possible failure modes) and the plausibility check's strictness.

## - 8.2.4.2 Signal Range Check - <chunk_seperator> Since this safety mechanism is able to detect only basic failure modes both internal and external to the HY-TTC 500 platform, the according diagnostic coverage is considered to be low, i.e. 60 %.

## 8.2.4.3 Internal Comparison Of Redundant Measurement Paths

Category: Comment ID: 959698 The analog 3 mode inputs' internal structure allows to continuously monitor the correct operation of the analog input stages. This procedure relies on an independent reference channel that allows permanent plausibility checks of the measurement channel when in voltage or current measurement modes. Failures will be detected by the I/O driver's diagnostic modules and trigger an according error callback. <chunk_seperator> Hinweis: Ein leerer Text bedeutet, dass der Schaltpunkt immer abgeschaltet ist. 5.4.4 Betriebszustand und Betriebsstunden (Operating state and Operating hours) <chunk_seperator> Regardless of the measurement mode, the connected input elements (e.g. switches or sensors) might require the implementation of certain safety mechanisms, as well, to assure failure detection within those elements. Such mechanisms have to be selected according to the possible failure modes and the targeted failure rates.

## 8.2.4.1 Redundancy

Category: Comment ID: 920872 The redundant usage of two analog inputs allows for continuous cross monitoring of the corresponding input signal. Plausibility checks within the application software permit the system integrator to detect a single fault in one of the input paths and transfer the overall system to a safe state. When defining the time interval of such checks, the system integrator needs to consider the overall system's failure reaction time. For details on calculating the worst case failure reaction times of such consistency checks, see section *Failure Diagnostics*. <chunk_seperator> In case the application software passes a safety configuration (i.e. defined signal ranges together with a redundant input channel) to the voltage/current input's initialization function, the measured values will be checked internally by the I/O driver for their upper and lower limits periodically during runtime and the I/O 
driver's diagnostic modules will trigger an error callback upon detection of a signal range violation. In case of single-channel configuration of 3 mode analog inputs or utilization as resistive inputs, the application software has to implement such a diagnostic measure. This measure can, of course, only be applied to input stages with sensors that allow to define lower and upper limit values that still lie within the measurable ranges.

Since this safety mechanism is able to detect only basic failure modes both internal and external to the HY-TTC 500 platform, the according diagnostic coverage is considered to be low, i.e. 60 %. <chunk_seperator> ## - 8.2.4.2 Signal Range Check -

Category: Comment ID: 544467 In order to check for short circuits to ground or battery voltage as well as open loads of dedicated inputs, a signal range check (SRC) can be utilized. That means a predefined margin on the upper and lower end of the measurable range is excluded from the sensor's valid output values. If for the signal range check a range of 5…95 % is configured to be valid for a sensor, all values below 5 % or above 95 % are considered erroneous by the I/O driver. <chunk_seperator> This safety measure is considered to provide a high diagnostic coverage (i.e. 99 %) for the internal input structure. The diagnostic capabilities for failures within the sensor device, however, might vary between different sensor devices and depend on their detailed internal diagnostics and the sensor's architectural category.

## - 8.2.5 Analog 2 Mode Inputs

Category: Comment ID: 920350 The analog 2 mode inputs enable ratiometric and absolute voltage measurements, as well as reading current sensors. According to the utilized input elements, different diagnostic measures might be suitable. 

Similar to the resistance measurement mode of the analog 3 mode inputs, the analog 2 mode inputs do not feature internal reference channels to claim diagnostic coverage values without additional measures. <chunk_seperator> ![104_image_0.png]( The image displays a large white sheet of paper with various columns and rows of numbers.

Question:  What type of safety mechanisms might be required for connected input elements, such as switches or sensors, to ensure failure detection within those elements?","The type of safety mechanisms that might be required for connected input elements, such as switches or sensors, to ensure failure detection within those elements are redundancy, signal range check, and internal comparison of redundant measurement paths. 

Redundancy involves the use of two or more identical input elements, such as analog inputs, to continuously monitor the input signal and detect a single fault in one of the input paths. This allows the system to transfer to a safe state in case of a failure.

Signal range check involves configuring a predefined margin on the upper and lower end of the measurable range to exclude invalid output values. This detects short circuits to ground or battery voltage, as well as open loads of dedicated inputs.

Internal comparison of redundant measurement paths involves the use of an independent reference channel to continuously monitor the correct operation of the analog input stages. This detects failures within the internal input structure and provides a high diagnostic coverage.

The selection of these safety mechanisms depends on the possible failure modes and the targeted failure rates of the input elements.

Question:  What is the function of a signal range check, and how does it detect short circuits to ground or battery voltage?","A signal range check (SRC) is a safety mechanism that detects short circuits to ground or battery voltage, as well as open loads of dedicated inputs, by excluding a predefined margin on the upper and lower end of the measurable range from the sensor's valid output values. 

In other words, the SRC sets a valid range of output values for a sensor, and any measured values that fall outside this range are considered erroneous. For instance, if the valid range is configured to be 5% to 95% of the measurable range, any values below 5% or above 95% would trigger an error callback. 

This mechanism is implemented by the I/O driver, which periodically checks the measured values against the predefined limits during runtime. If a signal range violation is detected, the I/O driver's diagnostic modules trigger an error callback. 

The SRC is particularly useful for detecting basic failure modes, both internal and external to the HY-TTC 500 platform, although its diagnostic coverage is considered to be relatively low, at around 60%."

On the other hand, analog 2 mode inputs do not feature internal reference channels, which means they do not have the same level of diagnostic coverage as analog 3 mode inputs. The diagnostic capabilities of analog 2 mode inputs are dependent on the utilized input elements, and different diagnostic measures might be suitable depending on the input elements used. For instance, signal range checks or redundancy can be implemented to detect failures, but these measures would need to be implemented externally, unlike the internal comparison of redundant measurement paths available in analog 3 mode inputs.

In summary, the main difference between the diagnostic capabilities of analog 2 mode inputs and analog 3 mode inputs lies in the presence of internal reference channels in analog 3 mode inputs, which enables higher diagnostic coverage. The diagnostic capabilities of analog 2 mode inputs are more dependent on the utilized input elements and may require external implementation of diagnostic measures."

## - Voltage Input / Current Input:

Due to the analog 2 mode inputs' internal structure, internal diagnostics cannot realiably detect dangerous failures on their own. Even though a basic signal range check will be performed by the HYTTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules for redundantly configured analog inputs, additional measures might be required to achieve the overall safety function's diagnostic coverage for the analog input stages.

Digital Input: In the digital input configuration, certain failure modes of the analog input stages might not be detectable by the HY-TTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules. Hence, a redundant usage of independent input stages is recommended for safety functions that require a certain diagnostic coverage.

Notice: If the temperature range is changed during the reference cycle, NO reset needs to be performed, as HYDACLAB automatically adapts to the new range. 

## 5.4.1.3 Output Scaling

In the output scaling menu you can set the upper range of operating hours, the HYDACLAB sensor thus counts the operating hours. 

The output signal for the operating hours is scaled to a value set by the user, i.e. 4mA 0 operating hours and 20 mA 10000 operating hours. This figure defines the maximum expected operating hours of the system since its last reset. Upper range Arrhenius: The Arrhenius rate defines the operating hours depending on temperature, the weighting is based on the Arrhenius equation. <chunk_seperator> Note 3: For details about the implementation of these safety measures see the according chapters in section *Analog Input 3 Modes*.

## - Voltage Input / Current Input:

Due to the analog 2 mode inputs' internal structure, internal diagnostics cannot realiably detect dangerous failures on their own. Even though a basic signal range check will be performed by the HYTTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules for redundantly configured analog inputs, additional measures might be required to achieve the overall safety function's diagnostic coverage for the analog input stages.

Digital Input: In the digital input configuration, certain failure modes of the analog input stages might not be detectable by the HY-TTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules. Hence, a redundant usage of independent input stages is recommended for safety functions that require a certain diagnostic coverage.

In the digital input configuration, certain failure modes of the timer input stages might not be detectable by the HY-TTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules. Hence, a redundant usage of independent input stages is recommended for safety functions that require a certain diagnostic coverage.

Regardless of the measurement mode, the connected input elements (e.g. switches or sensors) might require the implementation of certain safety mechanisms, as well, to assure failure detection within those elements. Such mechanisms have to be selected according to the possible failure modes and the targeted failure rates.

## 8.2.6.1 Redundancy <chunk_seperator> Category: Comment ID: 923491 The redundant usage of two timer inputs allows for continuous cross monitoring of the corresponding input signal. Plausibility checks within the application software permit the system integrator to detect a single fault in one of the input paths and transfer the overall system to a safe state. When defining the time interval of such checks, the system integrator needs to consider the overall system's failure reaction time. For details on calculating the worst case failure reaction times of such consistency checks, see section *Failure Diagnostics*. Redundancy can also be claimed when combining two different input types (e.g. a timer input's analog measurement with an analog input 2 mode, or a timer input's digital measurement with an analog input 3 mode for measuring static digital values), as long as the inputs' specifications both match the desired input signal.

For the timer input mode, the I/O driver's diagnostic modules allow to internally check the input signal for a predefined frequency and pulse width range. Apart from that, the application software can implement appropriate measures on their own, as well. Encoder Input:
The I/O driver's diagnostic modules allow defining a lower and upper threshold for the encoder's count value.

## Analog Input:

Similarly, the analog input measurement is not equipped with automatically enabled safety mechanisms. 

Therefore, no safety mechanisms can be claimed by the system integrator and additional measures have to be enabled, if the overall safety function requires diagnostic coverage for the analog input function.

## Digital Input:
Question:  What type of check is performed on the input signal in the timer input mode, and what range is checked?","In the timer input mode, the I/O driver's diagnostic modules perform a frequency range check on the input signal. Specifically, the check verifies that the input signal falls within a predefined frequency and pulse width range. This check ensures that the input signal is within the expected range, which is typically between 90-99% of the specified frequency range."

In the digital input configuration, certain failure modes of the timer input stages might not be detectable by the HY-TTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules. Hence, a redundant usage of independent input stages is recommended for safety functions that require a certain diagnostic coverage.

Regardless of the measurement mode, the connected input elements (e.g. switches or sensors) might require the implementation of certain safety mechanisms, as well, to assure failure detection within those elements. Such mechanisms have to be selected according to the possible failure modes and the targeted failure rates.

## 8.2.6.1 Redundancy <chunk_seperator> Category: Comment ID: 923491 The redundant usage of two timer inputs allows for continuous cross monitoring of the corresponding input signal. Plausibility checks within the application software permit the system integrator to detect a single fault in one of the input paths and transfer the overall system to a safe state. When defining the time interval of such checks, the system integrator needs to consider the overall system's failure reaction time. For details on calculating the worst case failure reaction times of such consistency checks, see section *Failure Diagnostics*. Redundancy can also be claimed when combining two different input types (e.g. a timer input's analog measurement with an analog input 2 mode, or a timer input's digital measurement with an analog input 3 mode for measuring static digital values), as long as the inputs' specifications both match the desired input signal. This safety mechanism's diagnostic coverage is considered to lie between a value of **90-99** <chunk_seperator> static digital values), as long as the inputs' specifications both match the desired input signal. This safety mechanism's diagnostic coverage is considered to lie between a value of **90-99** %, depending on the characteristics of the input elements (e.g. their possible failure modes) and the plausibility check's strictness. <chunk_seperator> Comparator Table 25

Redundancy can also be claimed when combining two different input types (e.g. a timer input's analog measurement with an analog input 2 mode, or a timer input's digital measurement with an analog input 3 mode for measuring static digital values), as long as the inputs' specifications both match the desired input signal. This safety mechanism's diagnostic coverage is considered to lie between a value of **90-99** <chunk_seperator> static digital values), as long as the inputs' specifications both match the desired input signal. This safety mechanism's diagnostic coverage is considered to lie between a value of **90-99** %, depending on the characteristics of the input elements (e.g. their possible failure modes) and the plausibility check's strictness. <chunk_seperator> Comparator Table 25

For the timer input mode, the I/O driver's diagnostic modules allow to internally check the input signal for a predefined frequency and pulse width range. Apart from that, the application software can implement appropriate measures on their own, as well. Encoder Input:
The I/O driver's diagnostic modules allow defining a lower and upper threshold for the encoder's count value.

## Analog Input:

Similarly, the analog input measurement is not equipped with automatically enabled safety mechanisms. 

Therefore, no safety mechanisms can be claimed by the system integrator and additional measures have to be enabled, if the overall safety function requires diagnostic coverage for the analog input function.

## Digital Input:
Question:  What determines the diagnostic coverage of the redundancy safety mechanism, and what percentage range is it considered to lie between?","The diagnostic coverage of the redundancy safety mechanism is determined by the characteristics of the input elements, such as their possible failure modes, and the plausibility check's strictness. It is considered to lie between a value of 90-99%, depending on the specific implementation and the overall system architecture.

In the context of the provided tables [table_36.png] and [table_37.png], the diagnostic coverage of the redundancy safety mechanism is influenced by the frequency range check, signal range check, and plausibility check. The redundancy safety mechanism's diagnostic coverage is claimed to be between 90-99%, as shown in [table_37.png].

The frequency range check, as described in the text, allows for the internal checking of the input signal for a predefined frequency and pulse width range. This check contributes to the overall diagnostic coverage of the redundancy safety mechanism.

The signal range check, as described in the text, allows for defining a lower and upper threshold for the encoder's count value. This check also contributes to the overall diagnostic coverage of the redundancy safety mechanism.

The plausibility check, as described in the text, permits the system integrator to detect a single fault in one of the input paths and transfer the overall system to a safe state. The plausibility check's strictness influences the diagnostic coverage of the redundancy safety mechanism.

In conclusion, the diagnostic coverage of the redundancy safety mechanism is determined by the combination of these checks and the characteristics of the input elements, and is considered to lie between 90-99%."

If for the signal range check a range of 5…95 % is considered to be valid for a sensor, all values below 5 % or above 95 % can be considered erroneous. The application software might check the measured values for their upper and lower limits periodically during runtime and is able to initiate the safe state upon detection of a signal range violation.

If for the signal range check a frequency range of 1 kHz…10 kHz is configured to be valid for a sensor, all values below 1 kHz or above 10 kHz are considered erroneous by the I/O driver.

For the timer input mode, the application software may pass a safety configuration (i.e. defined signal ranges) to the input's initialization function. The measured values will then be checked internally by the I/O drivers for their upper and lower limits periodically during runtime. This measure can, of course, only be applied to input stages with sensors that continuously generate output pulses even in their idle state. <chunk_seperator> <table_217>[{'IO_E_OK': 'everything fine'}, {'-------------------------': '-----------------------------------------------------------'}, {'IO_E_INVALID_CHANNEL_ID': ""the ECU variant doesn't support this feature""}, {'IO_E_CHANNEL_BUSY': 'the channel has already been initialized'}, {'IO_E_ETH_INIT_TIMEOUT': 'a timeout error occurred during Ethernet initialization'}, {'IO_E_ETH_INIT_FAIL': 'an error during Ethernet initialization occurred'}, {'IO_E_ETH_MAC_INVALID': 'the configured MAC address is invalid'}, {'IO_E_ETH_MDIO_TIMEOUT': 'a timeout error occurred when performing an MDIO transfer'}, {'IO_E_ETH_MDIO_READ': 'an MDIO read transfer error occurred'}, {'IO_E_INTERNAL_CSM': 'an internal error occurred'}]</table_217>

Question:  In which input mode is the internal signal range check not applicable, and why is it the responsibility of the application software to implement such a range check?","The internal signal range check is not applicable in the analog input mode of the timer inputs. This is because the internal signal range check is designed to detect short circuits to ground or battery voltage, as well as open loads of dedicated inputs, which is not relevant to the analog input mode.

In the analog input mode, the sensor's output values are continuous and can have any value within the measurable range. Therefore, the internal signal range check, which is based on predefined upper and lower limits, cannot be applied to the analog input mode.

It is the responsibility of the application software to implement a range check for the analog input mode. This is because the application software has more knowledge about the specific requirements and constraints of the analog input mode, and can implement a range check that is tailored to the specific needs of the application.

In the analog input mode, the range check can be implemented in a way that takes into account the specific characteristics of the sensor's output values, such as the maximum and minimum values, and the expected range of values. This can help to detect invalid measurement values and ensure the reliability of the measurement results.

Overall, the internal signal range check is a safety mechanism that is designed for specific input modes, such as digital input modes, and is not applicable to the analog input mode. It is the responsibility of the application software to implement a range check that is suitable for the analog input mode."

Question:  What is the feasibility of executing diverse safety measures depending on the actual measurement mode?","The feasibility of executing diverse safety measures depends on the actual measurement mode. In other words, the execution of safety measures is feasible and can be adapted according to the specific measurement mode being used. This is evident from the provided table [image_id.png] and the descriptions of the different input types, including timer inputs, analog inputs, and digital inputs. 

For instance, in the case of timer inputs, they can be used as secondary channels in a redundant architecture in combination with other timer inputs from a specific group (IO_PWD_00 ... IO_PWD_05). Similarly, analog inputs require additional safety measures to be enabled if the overall safety function demands diagnostic coverage for the analog input function. 

Moreover, digital inputs have specific constraints and can only be used in certain combinations with other inputs or outputs to ensure safety-critical operation. The PWM high side stages also provide a continuous monitoring mechanism and an independent secondary shut-off path to transfer the system to a safe state in case of dangerous failures. 

Therefore, the feasibility of executing diverse safety measures is dependent on the actual measurement mode and the specific requirements of each input type."

## - Timer Input:

Due to their internal structure, the timer inputs 6-11 (*IO_PWD_06 ... IO_PWD_11*) in measurement mode timer input **must not** be utilized safety-critically on their own or in combination with another timer input from this group. They may be used, however, as secondary channels in a redundant architecture in combination with timer inputs 0-5 (*IO_PWD_00 ... IO_PWD_05*).

## Analog Input:

Similarly, the analog input measurement is not equipped with automatically enabled safety mechanisms. 

Therefore, no safety mechanisms can be claimed by the system integrator and additional measures have to be enabled, if the overall safety function requires diagnostic coverage for the analog input function.

Question:  Why cannot timer inputs 6-11 be utilized safety-critically on their own or in combination with another timer input from the same group?","The reason why timer inputs 6-11 cannot be utilized safety-critically on their own or in combination with another timer input from the same group is that they are not equipped with automatically enabled safety mechanisms. This is because they are designed to operate in measurement mode as timer inputs, and their internal structure does not provide diagnostic coverage for safety-critical applications.

In other words, these timer inputs do not have built-in safety mechanisms that can detect and respond to faults or failures in a safety-critical manner. As a result, they cannot be relied upon to ensure safety in critical applications.

However, it is possible to use these timer inputs as secondary channels in a redundant architecture, in combination with other safety-enabled inputs, such as analog inputs, timer inputs 0-5, dedicated digital outputs, or PVG outputs. This allows the system to achieve the required level of safety and diagnostic coverage."

IO_PWD_05*).

## - Timer Input:

Due to their internal structure, the timer inputs 6-11 (*IO_PWD_06 ... IO_PWD_11*) in measurement mode timer input **must not** be utilized safety-critically on their own or in combination with another timer input from this group. They may be used, however, as secondary channels in a redundant architecture in combination with timer inputs 0-5 (*IO_PWD_00 ... IO_PWD_05*).

## Analog Input:

Similarly, the analog input measurement is not equipped with automatically enabled safety mechanisms. 

Therefore, no safety mechanisms can be claimed by the system integrator and additional measures have to be enabled, if the overall safety function requires diagnostic coverage for the analog input function.

## Digital Input: <chunk_seperator> ## 8.2.8 Pwm High Side Stages

Category: Comment ID: 921278 The PWM high side stages allow operation of both resistive and inductive loads in a safety-critical manner. Due to the PWM control, they feature a continuous monitoring mechanism in the granularity of the PWM frequency. With internal safety switches being able to override a faulty power stage output, an independent secondary shut-off path is present to transfer the system to a safe state, in case of dangerous failures. <chunk_seperator> With the sub-functions of the function ""*Network Management***"", the HMG 4000 can ""simulate""** the tasks of a *CANopen Masters* by providing the most important *NMT messages*. 

![155_image_0.png]( The image displays a computer screen with two different views of a network management system. In one view, there are several options for managing networks, including a section labeled ""CavoMasters."" This area provides information on various tasks and settings related to the network.

In the second view, there is an extensive list of messages displayed in a grid-like pattern. The messages appear to be important notifications or updates that users need to be aware of. Overall, the image showcases the functionality and organization of a network management system.)

Using the functions provided, the *NMT status* **of the connected network participants can be** 
changed. 

## 5.2. Pcan-View

A widely used PC-based program for the visualisation of CAN messages is PCAN view by <chunk_seperator> ![61_image_2.png]( The image displays a computer screen with several lines of text and numbers on it. There are multiple instances of the number ""10"" visible throughout the screen, indicating that this could be related to a measurement or data analysis process. Additionally, there is a reference to a ""reservoir"" in one part of the screen. The overall content suggests that the image may represent some form of technical documentation or data visualization.) <chunk_seperator> ![57_image_0.png]( The image displays a graph with a blue background and white text on it. The graph shows a line that is going downwards, possibly indicating a decrease or negative trend. There are two numbers visible at the top of the graph, which might be related to the data being displayed. Additionally, there are three other smaller graphs in the image, each with different colors and shapes, likely providing more information about the data being analyzed.)

Due to their internal structure, the timer inputs 6-11 (*IO_PWD_06 ... IO_PWD_11*) in measurement mode digital input **must not** be utilized safety-critically on their own or in combination with another timer input from this group. They may be used, however, as secondary channels in a redundant architecture in combination with dedicated analog inputs, timer inputs 0-5, dedicated digital outputs or PVG outputs (*IO_ADC_00 ...

## Hs Pwm Output:

The I/O driver's diagnostic module continuously compares the desired output duty cycle and frequency with the feedback measurements, thus allowing to reliably detect failures within the PWM output stages. This measure is active for every PWM high side output that is initialized as safety-critical and will trigger an error callback in case of dangerous failures. Due to their superior diagnostic capabilities, the system integrator is advised to use the PWM output mode rather than the digital output mode for safety-critical applications, even if the corresponding actuators are only operated statically. This can be achieved by implementing a pseude-digital mode, that only changes between minimum and maximum output duty cycles.

Category: Comment ID: 1194918 In order to check the proper operation of the secondary shut-off path, its ability to transfer the system into a safe state needs to be tested in certain intervals, e.g. at the beginning of each driving cycle or during pre-defined maintenance activities. That way, the system can be considered to offer a valid category 2 architecture, according to ISO 13849.

## 8.2.8.4 Redundancy <chunk_seperator> ## 8.2.8.4 Redundancy

Category: Comment ID: 921253 The redundant usage of independent digital inputs allows for continuous cross monitoring of the corresponding input signal. Plausibility checks within the application software permit the system integrator to detect a single fault in one of the input paths and transfer the overall system to a safe state. When defining the time interval of such checks, the system integrator needs to consider the overall system's failure reaction time. For details on calculating the worst case failure reaction times of such consistency checks, see section *Failure Diagnostics*.

Redundancy can also be claimed when combining two different input types (e.g. a PWM stage's digital input measurement with an timer input, or a PWM stage's digital input measurement with the digital sampling of an analog input 3 mode), as long as the inputs' specifications both match the desired input signal. <chunk_seperator> This safety mechanism's diagnostic coverage is considered to lie between a value of **90-99** %, depending on the characteristics of the input elements (e.g. their possible failure modes) and the plausibility check's strictness.

Category: Comment ID: 894367 The digital high side stages allow operation of both resistive and inductive loads in a safety-critical manner. They feature internal feedback mechanisms that allow continuous monitoring of the effective output voltage. In case of dangerous failures, the assigned low side outputs act as secondary shut-off paths that provide the ability for transfering the system into a safe state. <chunk_seperator> ## 4.6.2.

In case the PWM output stages current measurement is also defined as safety-critical, the I/O driver's diagnostic module provides an implicitly executed range check that is able to detect basic failures within the current measurement path of the output stage. When detecting such failures, the I/O driver's diagnostic module will trigger an error callback. If the system integrator requires higher DC values, the implementation of additional measures (e.g. plausibility checks of the measured current values) within the application software is required.

If explicitly configured as digital outputs, the PWM high side stages will be operated statically and will not make use of any PWM signals. The state of such digital outputs will not be automatically monitored by the I/O driver's diagnostic modules.

Category: Comment ID: 923888 The integrity of the measured PWM output current can be checked by performing dedicated plausibility checks with independent measurement signals. That could be, for example, the direct comparison to an independent current sensor or the evaluation of the controlled actuators' physical state (with position or speed sensors). Another practical plausibility check for the safety-critical current measurement would be to check the actual current measurement value against an expected current, based on the PWM output's duty cycle and the actuator's resistive characteristics.

Depending on the plausibility check's strictness, diagnostic coverage values between 90 % and 99 % are considered feasible.

## 8.2.8.2 Status Monitoring

Category: Comment ID: 923591 The digital state of the PWM high side outputs can be read via the static feedback signals. That way, the application software is able to verify the correct function of the digital high side outputs and activate the safe state in case of dangerous failures. The additional internal safety switches constitute a secondary shut-off path that can de-energize the actuators independently from the PWM power stages. This safety mechanism allows to detect a substantial amount of possible hardware failures and is therefore considered to yield a DC value of 90 %.

## 8.2.8.1 Plausibility Check
Question:  What is the diagnostic coverage value of the redundant usage of independent digital inputs, and what factors affect this value?","The diagnostic coverage value of the redundant usage of independent digital inputs lies between 90% and 99%. This value is affected by several factors, including the characteristics of the input elements, such as their possible failure modes, and the strictness of the plausibility checks implemented within the application software.

In particular, the redundant usage of independent digital inputs allows for continuous cross-monitoring of the corresponding input signals, enabling the system integrator to detect a single fault in one of the input paths and transfer the overall system to a safe state. The diagnostic coverage value depends on the ability of the plausibility checks to detect failures in the input paths, which in turn depends on the characteristics of the input elements and the strictness of the checks.

For instance, if the input elements have a high probability of failing in a specific manner, the plausibility checks may be more effective in detecting such failures, resulting in a higher diagnostic coverage value. On the other hand, if the input elements have a low probability of failing in a specific manner, the plausibility checks may be less effective, resulting in a lower diagnostic coverage value.

Additionally, the time interval of the plausibility checks also affects the diagnostic coverage value. If the checks are performed at a high frequency, the system is more likely to detect failures quickly, resulting in a higher diagnostic coverage value. Conversely, if the checks are performed at a low frequency, the system may take longer to detect failures, resulting in a lower diagnostic coverage value.

## 7.7.2 Digital Output Protection

Each digital output is individually protected against overcurrent. Whenever a fatal overcurrent situation is detected on any safe or unsafe digital output, the output is disabled by software. Note that disabled by software means that the output is set to low but the state of the safety switch (if configured) remains unchanged.

When entering the protection state, the digital output has to remain in this state for the given wait time. After this wait time the digital output can be reenabled via function **IO_DO_ResetProtection()**. Note that the number of reenabling operations for a single digital output is limited to 10. Refer to function IO_DO_ResetProtection() for more information on how to reenable a digital output.

Analog Input: The digital high side stages' analog input measurement is not equipped with automatically enabled safety mechanisms. Therefore, no safety mechanisms can be claimed by the system integrator and additional measures have to be enabled, if the overall safety function requires diagnostic coverage for the analog input function.

## Digital Input:

In the digital input configuration, certain failure modes of the digital high side stages (including an unintentional activation of power stages) might not be detectable by the HY-TTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules. Hence, a redundant usage of independent input stages is recommended for safety functions that require a certain diagnostic coverage.

Question:  What is the function of the redundant shut-off path in the secondary shut-off path configuration?","The function of the redundant shut-off path in the secondary shut-off path configuration is to provide an additional layer of safety by monitoring one of the actuators.

Analog Input: The digital high side stages' analog input measurement is not equipped with automatically enabled safety mechanisms. Therefore, no safety mechanisms can be claimed by the system integrator and additional measures have to be enabled, if the overall safety function requires diagnostic coverage for the analog input function.

## Digital Input:

In the digital input configuration, certain failure modes of the digital high side stages (including an unintentional activation of power stages) might not be detectable by the HY-TTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules. Hence, a redundant usage of independent input stages is recommended for safety functions that require a certain diagnostic coverage.

## 7.7.2 Digital Output Protection

Each digital output is individually protected against overcurrent. Whenever a fatal overcurrent situation is detected on any safe or unsafe digital output, the output is disabled by software. Note that disabled by software means that the output is set to low but the state of the safety switch (if configured) remains unchanged.

When entering the protection state, the digital output has to remain in this state for the given wait time. After this wait time the digital output can be reenabled via function **IO_DO_ResetProtection()**. Note that the number of reenabling operations for a single digital output is limited to 10. Refer to function IO_DO_ResetProtection() for more information on how to reenable a digital output.

Category: Comment ID: 894468 The redundant usage of independent inputs allows for continuous cross monitoring of the corresponding input signal.

## 8.2.9.4 Signal Range Check

Category: Comment ID: 923589 In order to check for short circuits to ground or battery voltage as well as open loads of dedicated inputs, a signal range check (SRC) can be utilized. That means a predefined margin on the upper and lower end of the measurable range is excluded from the sensor's valid output values. If for the signal range check a range of 5…95 % is considered to be valid for a sensor, all values below 5 % or above 95 % should be considered erroneous by the application software. <chunk_seperator> Unlike the analog 2 mode and 3 mode inputs, the digital high side outputs do not offer an internal signal range check that is executed by the I/O driver's diagnostic modules. It is, therefore, in the responsibility of the application software to implement such a range check.

Question:  How often should the secondary shut-off path be tested to ensure its proper operation?","According to the provided information, the secondary shut-off path should be tested at certain intervals, such as at the beginning of each driving cycle or during pre-defined maintenance activities, to ensure its proper operation. This is necessary to confirm that the system can transfer into a safe state in case of a failure, thereby maintaining a valid Category 2 architecture as per ISO 13849."

Category: Comment ID: 894468 The redundant usage of independent inputs allows for continuous cross monitoring of the corresponding input signal. Plausibility checks within the application software permit the system integrator to detect a single fault in one of the input paths and transfer the overall system to a safe state. When defining the time interval of such checks, the system integrator needs to consider the overall system's failure reaction time. For details on calculating the worst case failure reaction times of such consistency checks, see section *Failure Diagnostics*.

Redundancy can also be claimed when combining two different input types (e.g. a digital output stage's analog input measurement with an analog input 3 mode, or a digital output stage's digital input measurement with a timer input), as long as the inputs' specifications both match the desired input signal. <chunk_seperator> In addition to the main components, there are three more smaller objects in the scene: two located near the top left corner and another one towards the bottom right corner.

## 8.2.9.4 Signal Range Check

Category: Comment ID: 923589 In order to check for short circuits to ground or battery voltage as well as open loads of dedicated inputs, a signal range check (SRC) can be utilized. That means a predefined margin on the upper and lower end of the measurable range is excluded from the sensor's valid output values. If for the signal range check a range of 5…95 % is considered to be valid for a sensor, all values below 5 % or above 95 % should be considered erroneous by the application software. <chunk_seperator> Unlike the analog 2 mode and 3 mode inputs, the digital high side outputs do not offer an internal signal range check that is executed by the I/O driver's diagnostic modules. It is, therefore, in the responsibility of the application software to implement such a range check. Since this safety mechanism is able to detect only basic failure modes both internal and external to the HY-TTC 500 platform, the according diagnostic coverage is considered to be low, i.e. 60 %.

"You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the context that the user gives to answer the question. Treat the context as your internal knowledge, hence do not explicitly mention the ""context"" in your answer like ""Based on the provided context..."".If your answer relates to any image description given below, you should refer explicitly to the image ID in your answer with the format [image_id.png].Give a long and detailed answer.","Context: ## - Ls Digital Output:

The I/O driver's diagnostic module continuously compares the desired output status with the feedback measurements, thus allowing to detect failures within the digital low side output stages. This measure is active for every pair of digital high side output and digital low side output that is initialized as safetycritical and will trigger an error callback in case of dangerous failures.

If the digital low side output is not configured safety-critical—and thus, is not used in combination with a digital high side output—no safety measures are executed by the I/O driver's diagnostic modules.

## Analog Input:

Question:  What is the purpose of the paths that provide the ability for transferring the system into a safe state?","The purpose of the paths that provide the ability for transferring the system into a safe state is to detect failures within the digital low side output stages and bring the overall system to a safe state in case of dangerous failures. These paths, also referred to as secondary shut-off paths, are designed to provide a redundant means of shutting off the system in case of failure detection. They can be configured as independent output stages or hydraulic shut-off valves, and their purpose is to ensure the system's safety by preventing dangerous movements or actions."

Question:  What is the recommended approach for safety functions that require a certain diagnostic coverage in the digital input configuration?","According to the provided information, for safety functions that require a certain diagnostic coverage in the digital input configuration, a redundant usage of independent input stages is recommended. This is because certain failure modes of the digital low side stages, including unintentional activation of power stages, might not be detectable by the HY-TTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules. By using redundant input stages, the system can ensure a higher level of diagnostic coverage and safety."

The I/O driver's diagnostic module continuously compares the desired output status with the feedback measurements, thus allowing to detect failures within the digital low side output stages. This measure is active for every pair of digital high side output and digital low side output that is initialized as safetycritical and will trigger an error callback in case of dangerous failures.

If the digital low side output is not configured safety-critical—and thus, is not used in combination with a digital high side output—no safety measures are executed by the I/O driver's diagnostic modules.

## Analog Input:

The digital low side stages' analog input measurement is not equipped with automatically enabled safety mechanisms. Therefore, no safety mechanisms can be claimed by the system integrator and additional measures have to be enabled, if the overall safety function requires diagnostic coverage for the analog input function.

## 8.2.10.3 Redundancy
Question:  How does the redundant usage of independent inputs in a system allow for continuous cross monitoring of the corresponding input signal?","The redundant usage of independent inputs in a system allows for continuous cross monitoring of the corresponding input signal by enabling the system to detect a single fault in one of the input paths and transfer the overall system to a safe state. This is achieved through plausibility checks within the application software, which permit the system integrator to monitor the input signals continuously and identify any inconsistencies or faults. 

By using independent inputs, the system can compare the input signals and detect any deviations or errors, ensuring that the system operates safely and reliably. This redundant usage of independent inputs provides a diagnostic coverage of 90-99%, depending on the characteristics of the input elements and the plausibility check's strictness. 

For instance, if a system uses two different input types, such as a digital output stage's analog input measurement with an analog input 3 mode, or a digital output stage's digital input measurement with a timer input, the system can continuously monitor the input signals and detect any faults or inconsistencies. This allows the system to transfer to a safe state in case of a fault, ensuring the overall safety and reliability of the system."

Question:  Why is it necessary for the system integrator to implement a plausibility check of the output stage's feedback value for the high side digital outputs?","It is necessary for the system integrator to implement a plausibility check of the output stage's feedback value for the high side digital outputs because the state of the digital high side outputs will not be automatically monitored by the I/O driver's diagnostic modules. This means that the system integrator needs to take additional measures to ensure the reliability and safety of the system. 

Without such a plausibility check, certain failure modes of the digital high side stages, including unintentional activation of power stages, might not be detectable by the HY-TTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules. This could lead to a loss of safety function and compromise the overall system's reliability. 

By implementing a plausibility check, the system integrator can ensure that the output stage's feedback value is valid and reliable, which is essential for safety-critical systems.

Category: Comment ID: 592087 For being capable of providing analog inputs for safety-critical applications, the HY-TTC 500 platform requires diagnostic measures to be present within the analog input path. Depending on the analog input type, the system integrator may have to comply with specific requirements in order to allow safety-critical utilization, as specified in the before-mentioned section *Analog Inputs*.

The following section will describe typical analog sensor types together with their detailed characteristics.

## 9.1.1 Usage Of Redundant Sensors

Category: Comment ID: 592125 Redundantly connected sensors do allow the reliable detection of failures within a single sensor path. 

However, for those failures that commonly compromise both sensor signals at once, e.g. short circuits between the separate sensor lines, dedicated preconditions are necessary.

## 9.1.1.1 Diverse Sensor Characteristics <chunk_seperator> ## 8.2.11.1 Status Monitoring

Category: Comment ID: 924867 The current state of the digital high side outputs can be read via the static feedback signals. That way, the application software is able to verify the correct function of the digital high side outputs and activate the safe state in case of dangerous failures. Since the HY-TTC 500 platform does not offer an integral shut-off path that allows to independently disable the connected actuator, the system integrator is responsible to provide other means that allow bringing the overall system to a safe state, e.g. by a separate emergency valve that disrupts the hydraulic oil flow and stops any dangerous movements or by utilizing an independent digital low side output of the HY-TTC 500 platform. This safety mechanism allows to detect a substantial amount of possible hardware failures and—with a proper secondary shut-off path in place—is therefore considered to yield a DC value of 90 %.

Category: Comment ID: 925638 In order to check for short circuits to ground or battery voltage as well as open loads of dedicated inputs, a signal range check (SRC) can be utilized. That means a predefined margin on the upper and lower end of the measurable range is excluded from the sensor's valid output values. If for the signal range check a range of 5…95 % is configured to be valid for a sensor, all values below 5 % or above 95 % should be considered erroneous by the application software. <chunk_seperator> ## 9.1 Analog Sensors

Category: Comment ID: 592087 For being capable of providing analog inputs for safety-critical applications, the HY-TTC 500 platform requires diagnostic measures to be present within the analog input path. Depending on the analog input type, the system integrator may have to comply with specific requirements in order to allow safety-critical utilization, as specified in the before-mentioned section *Analog Inputs*.

The following section will describe typical analog sensor types together with their detailed characteristics.

## 9.1.1 Usage Of Redundant Sensors

Category: Comment ID: 592125 Redundantly connected sensors do allow the reliable detection of failures within a single sensor path. 

However, for those failures that commonly compromise both sensor signals at once, e.g. short circuits between the separate sensor lines, dedicated preconditions are necessary.

## 9.1.1.1 Diverse Sensor Characteristics <chunk_seperator> ## 8.2.11.1 Status Monitoring

Category: Comment ID: 924867 The current state of the digital high side outputs can be read via the static feedback signals. That way, the application software is able to verify the correct function of the digital high side outputs and activate the safe state in case of dangerous failures. Since the HY-TTC 500 platform does not offer an integral shut-off path that allows to independently disable the connected actuator, the system integrator is responsible to provide other means that allow bringing the overall system to a safe state, e.g. by a separate emergency valve that disrupts the hydraulic oil flow and stops any dangerous movements or by utilizing an independent digital low side output of the HY-TTC 500 platform. This safety mechanism allows to detect a substantial amount of possible hardware failures and—with a proper secondary shut-off path in place—is therefore considered to yield a DC value of 90 %.

Category: Comment ID: 964502 In order to check the proper operation of the secondary shut-off path, its ability to transfer the system into a safe state needs to be tested in certain intervals, e.g. at the beginning of each driving cycle or during pre-defined maintenance activities. That way, the system can be considered to offer a valid category 2 architecture, according to ISO 13849.

## 8.2.11.3 Redundancy <chunk_seperator> Unlike the analog 2 mode and 3 mode inputs, the digital high side outputs do not offer an internal signal range check that is executed by the I/O driver's diagnostic modules. It is, therefore, in the responsibility of the application software to implement such a range check. Since this safety mechanism is able to detect only basic failure modes both internal and external to the HY-TTC 500 platform, the according diagnostic coverage is considered to be low, i.e. 60 %.

Category: Comment ID: 925634 The redundant usage of independent inputs allows for continuous cross monitoring of the corresponding input signal. Plausibility checks within the application software permit the system integrator to detect a single fault in one of the input paths and transfer the overall system to a safe state. When defining the time interval of such checks, the system integrator needs to consider the overall system's failure reaction time. For details on calculating the worst case failure reaction times of such consistency checks, see section *Failure Diagnostics*. <chunk_seperator> Dans l'exemple ci-contre, les mesures de **quatre**

Category: Comment ID: 925638 In order to check for short circuits to ground or battery voltage as well as open loads of dedicated inputs, a signal range check (SRC) can be utilized. That means a predefined margin on the upper and lower end of the measurable range is excluded from the sensor's valid output values. If for the signal range check a range of 5…95 % is configured to be valid for a sensor, all values below 5 % or above 95 % should be considered erroneous by the application software. <chunk_seperator> ## 9.1 Analog Sensors

Category: Comment ID: 592087 For being capable of providing analog inputs for safety-critical applications, the HY-TTC 500 platform requires diagnostic measures to be present within the analog input path. Depending on the analog input type, the system integrator may have to comply with specific requirements in order to allow safety-critical utilization, as specified in the before-mentioned section *Analog Inputs*.

The following section will describe typical analog sensor types together with their detailed characteristics.

## 9.1.1 Usage Of Redundant Sensors

Category: Comment ID: 592125 Redundantly connected sensors do allow the reliable detection of failures within a single sensor path. 

However, for those failures that commonly compromise both sensor signals at once, e.g. short circuits between the separate sensor lines, dedicated preconditions are necessary.

## 9.1.1.1 Diverse Sensor Characteristics <chunk_seperator> ## 8.2.11.1 Status Monitoring

Category: Comment ID: 924867 The current state of the digital high side outputs can be read via the static feedback signals. That way, the application software is able to verify the correct function of the digital high side outputs and activate the safe state in case of dangerous failures. Since the HY-TTC 500 platform does not offer an integral shut-off path that allows to independently disable the connected actuator, the system integrator is responsible to provide other means that allow bringing the overall system to a safe state, e.g. by a separate emergency valve that disrupts the hydraulic oil flow and stops any dangerous movements or by utilizing an independent digital low side output of the HY-TTC 500 platform. This safety mechanism allows to detect a substantial amount of possible hardware failures and—with a proper secondary shut-off path in place—is therefore considered to yield a DC value of 90 %.

Category: Comment ID: 964502 In order to check the proper operation of the secondary shut-off path, its ability to transfer the system into a safe state needs to be tested in certain intervals, e.g. at the beginning of each driving cycle or during pre-defined maintenance activities. That way, the system can be considered to offer a valid category 2 architecture, according to ISO 13849.

## 8.2.11.3 Redundancy <chunk_seperator> Unlike the analog 2 mode and 3 mode inputs, the digital high side outputs do not offer an internal signal range check that is executed by the I/O driver's diagnostic modules. It is, therefore, in the responsibility of the application software to implement such a range check. Since this safety mechanism is able to detect only basic failure modes both internal and external to the HY-TTC 500 platform, the according diagnostic coverage is considered to be low, i.e. 60 %.

Category: Comment ID: 592129 If redundant sensors are used for detection of short circuits between sensor lines, external to the ECU, 
sensors with diverse characteristics are recommended in order to continuously monitor the signal lines for external short circuits. The following types of diverse sensors are commonly used:
- Two identical potentiometers with opposite characteristics (i.e. when changing the physical input value, one sensor reacts with an increasing sensor value while the other one reacts with a decreasing sensor value). With a short circuit between those two sensors, the ECU will measure a value of 50 % full range for both sensors. This output value is plausible but wrong. <chunk_seperator> As a consequence, this kind of diverse sensor operation is only feasible for sensors that result in safe output conditions when emitting a sensor value of 50 %. This could be, for example, a joystick containing two sensors with opposite characteristics. In its idle position, as well as when the sensor lines are shorted, it outputs sensor values of 50 %, each. Basically, a short circuit would not be detected by the application software, but this condition would lead to a safe condition, anyway.

- Two identical potentiometers with different proportional factor at their outputs. That could mean, for example, that the one sensor outputs a value that is double the voltage of the second sensor, for any position. That way, the both sensors can never show the same output values at the same time, enabling the application software to detect short circuits between these sensor lines.

## 9.1.1.2 Indentical Sensor Characteristics <chunk_seperator> ## 9.1.2 Potentiometric Analog Sensors

Category: Comment ID: 592117 Potentiometric analog sensors are commonly used for analog position sensors (e.g. pedals or joysticks), 
movement sensors or active sensors that resemble the behavior of potentiometers. These sensors produce an analog output voltage that is proportional to the mechanical position as well as to the sensor supply. Consequently, a linear position sensor being in its center position will show an output signal with a voltage of exactly 50 % of the sensor supply voltage. By using the ratiometric measurement, the sensor supply's error does not influence the measurement value accuracy. Please note that it is not allowed to supply a sensor by one ECU and measure the sensor's output signal on another ECU. Ground shifts between the two ECUs would considerably degrade the measurement accuracy.

Since the HY-TTC 500 platform does provide measures to identify external short circuits between two redundantly used sensors with identical characteristics, the system integrator can rely on the mechanisms to detect these external short circuits during start-up, as described in section *External Short* Circuit Check.

Question:  How do two identical potentiometers with opposite characteristics react when there is a short circuit between them?","When there is a short circuit between two identical potentiometers with opposite characteristics, the ECU will measure a value of 50% full range for both sensors. This output value is plausible but wrong. 

To explain this further, let's consider the scenario where one sensor reacts with an increasing sensor value when the physical input value changes, while the other sensor reacts with a decreasing sensor value. In the absence of a short circuit, each sensor would output a value that corresponds to the physical input value. However, when a short circuit occurs between the two sensors, the output values of both sensors will converge to 50% of the full range. This is because the short circuit effectively connects the two sensors in parallel, causing their output values to average out.

For example, if the physical input value corresponds to a sensor output of 75% on one sensor and 25% on the other, a short circuit would cause both sensors to output 50%. This is a wrong but plausible output value, as it falls within the expected range of the sensors. The application software may not detect this as a short circuit, but it would still lead to a safe condition, as in the case of a joystick containing two sensors with opposite characteristics, which outputs sensor values of 50% in its idle position as well as when the sensor lines are shorted."

## 9.1.1.2 Indentical Sensor Characteristics <chunk_seperator> ## 9.1.2 Potentiometric Analog Sensors

Category: Comment ID: 592117 Potentiometric analog sensors are commonly used for analog position sensors (e.g. pedals or joysticks), 
movement sensors or active sensors that resemble the behavior of potentiometers. These sensors produce an analog output voltage that is proportional to the mechanical position as well as to the sensor supply. Consequently, a linear position sensor being in its center position will show an output signal with a voltage of exactly 50 % of the sensor supply voltage. By using the ratiometric measurement, the sensor supply's error does not influence the measurement value accuracy. Please note that it is not allowed to supply a sensor by one ECU and measure the sensor's output signal on another ECU. Ground shifts between the two ECUs would considerably degrade the measurement accuracy.

Question:  What is the advantage of using identical sensors for redundancy, despite not being able to detect short circuits between sensor lines?","The advantage of using identical sensors for redundancy, despite not being able to detect short circuits between sensor lines, is that it allows for the best precision regarding measurement accuracy. This is because identical sensors will provide the same output values for the same physical input, which enables the system to accurately measure the desired parameter. In contrast, using diverse sensors with different characteristics, as described in section 9.1.1.1, may compromise measurement accuracy in order to detect short circuits. Therefore, in applications where high precision is crucial, using identical sensors for redundancy is a suitable approach, even though it does not provide short circuit detection capabilities. However, it is worth noting that the HY-TTC 500 platform provides mechanisms to detect external short circuits between two redundantly used sensors with identical characteristics during start-up, as described in section *External Short* Circuit Check."

Category: Comment ID: 592129 If redundant sensors are used for detection of short circuits between sensor lines, external to the ECU, 
sensors with diverse characteristics are recommended in order to continuously monitor the signal lines for external short circuits. The following types of diverse sensors are commonly used:
- Two identical potentiometers with opposite characteristics (i.e. when changing the physical input value, one sensor reacts with an increasing sensor value while the other one reacts with a decreasing sensor value). With a short circuit between those two sensors, the ECU will measure a value of 50 % full range for both sensors. This output value is plausible but wrong. <chunk_seperator> As a consequence, this kind of diverse sensor operation is only feasible for sensors that result in safe output conditions when emitting a sensor value of 50 %. This could be, for example, a joystick containing two sensors with opposite characteristics. In its idle position, as well as when the sensor lines are shorted, it outputs sensor values of 50 %, each. Basically, a short circuit would not be detected by the application software, but this condition would lead to a safe condition, anyway.

- Two identical potentiometers with different proportional factor at their outputs. That could mean, for example, that the one sensor outputs a value that is double the voltage of the second sensor, for any position. That way, the both sensors can never show the same output values at the same time, enabling the application software to detect short circuits between these sensor lines.

Without rotation, the output is statically low or high, depending on whether there is a tooth or a gap next to the active sensor region. When using traditional sensors, however, an idle sensor may be confused with a defective sensor connection (i.e. a shorted sensor line or a broken wire). In order to distinguish between the conditions no speed or *defective sensor*, the following measures can be applied:
- An RPM sensor that emits a test pulse (e.g. one pulse every 100 ms) while standing still. If the signal is stuck at any level, the application can expect the sensor or its signal lines to be defective and may activate the safe state. <chunk_seperator> -

## 9.2.3 Digital Switches

Category: Comment ID: 592099 Digital switches that statically emit logical high or low levels, do not provide any measures for detection of potential failures, typically. Thus, the system integrator has to redundantly utilize two separate inputs when requiring safety-critical inputs. The application software is responsible for comparing the measurements and change to the safe state in case of discrepancies between both input values.

Category: Comment ID: 592101 During operation, redundantly used digital switches may show a certain offset regarding their actual switching threshold. Consequently, there may be a particular time period where the comparison of the sensors' input values appears to be implausible. The system integrator is advised to provide adequate debouncing of those intermediate states within the application software.

## 9.2.3 Digital Switches
Question:  What is the necessary requirement for system integrators when using general digital sensors in safety-critical applications?","When using general digital sensors in safety-critical applications, the necessary requirement for system integrators is the redundant usage of separate digital timer inputs. This is because digital sensors, such as PWM position sensors, RPM sensors, and digital switches, do not provide any means to reliably detect failures, such as short circuits or open circuits of the sensor lines.

For instance, PWM position sensors, which are typically analog sensors with potentiometers or contactless active sensors providing PWM signals, do not have any built-in diagnostic capabilities to detect failures. Therefore, the application has to monitor and compare the measurement values and enter the safe state in case of deviations between the independent inputs.

Similarly, RPM sensors, which are active sensors with magnetically sensitive detectors, can be confused with a defective sensor connection if the output is statically low or high, depending on whether there is a tooth or a gap next to the active sensor region. To distinguish between the conditions no speed or defective sensor, measures such as emitting a test pulse while standing still or utilizing two separate timer inputs can be applied.

Digital switches, which statically emit logical high or low levels, also do not provide any measures for detection of potential failures. Thus, the system integrator has to redundantly utilize two separate inputs when requiring safety-critical inputs.

In summary, the redundant usage of separate digital timer inputs is a necessary requirement for system integrators when using general digital sensors in safety-critical applications to ensure the reliability and safety of the system."

Category: Comment ID: 592099 Digital switches that statically emit logical high or low levels, do not provide any measures for detection of potential failures, typically. Thus, the system integrator has to redundantly utilize two separate inputs when requiring safety-critical inputs. The application software is responsible for comparing the measurements and change to the safe state in case of discrepancies between both input values.

Category: Comment ID: 592101 During operation, redundantly used digital switches may show a certain offset regarding their actual switching threshold. Consequently, there may be a particular time period where the comparison of the sensors' input values appears to be implausible.

Without rotation, the output is statically low or high, depending on whether there is a tooth or a gap next to the active sensor region. When using traditional sensors, however, an idle sensor may be confused with a defective sensor connection (i.e. a shorted sensor line or a broken wire). In order to distinguish between the conditions no speed or *defective sensor*, the following measures can be applied:
- An RPM sensor that emits a test pulse (e.g. one pulse every 100 ms) while standing still. If the signal is stuck at any level, the application can expect the sensor or its signal lines to be defective and may activate the safe state. <chunk_seperator> -

## 9.2.3 Digital Switches

Category: Comment ID: 592099 Digital switches that statically emit logical high or low levels, do not provide any measures for detection of potential failures, typically. Thus, the system integrator has to redundantly utilize two separate inputs when requiring safety-critical inputs. The application software is responsible for comparing the measurements and change to the safe state in case of discrepancies between both input values.

Category: Comment ID: 592101 During operation, redundantly used digital switches may show a certain offset regarding their actual switching threshold.

Execution of the control function programmed by the system integrator (e.g. controlling the outputs in accordance to input values) in a fail-safe principle.

## - Safety Integrity Level (Sil)

Discrete level (one out of a possible four) for specifying the safety integrity requirements of the safety functions to be allocated to the E/E/PE safety-related systems, where SIL 4 has the highest level of safety integrity and SIL 1 has the lowest (IEC 61508-4).

## Safety Lifecycle

Necessary activities involved in the implementation of safety-related systems, occurring during a period of time that starts at the concept phase of a project and finishes when all of the E/E/PE safety-related systems, other technology safety-related systems and external risk reduction facilities are no longer available for use.

## Software Cycle <chunk_seperator> Fault Abnormal condition that may cause a reduction in, or loss of, the capability of a functional unit to perform a required function.

Fault Tolerance The ability of a functional unit to continue to perform a required function in the presence of faults or errors. Failure The termination of the ability of a functional unit to perform a required function.

## Performance Level (Pl)

Discrete level (one out of a possible five) used for specifying the system's ability to perform a safety function under foreseeable conditions, where performance level e has the highest level of safety integrity and performance level a has the lowest. (ISO 13849-1)

## Periodically <chunk_seperator> Category: Comment ID: 1534715 The following table covers all those functional blocks for which the HY-TTC 580 platform does not provide any diagnostic measures. However, the system integrator may implement measures against dangerous failures on system level. To that end, every block's overall failure rate is assumed to be evenly distributed between safe and dangerous failures according to the general approach in ISO 13849, i.e. 

MTTFd = 2 * MTTF. The diagnostic measures and the determination of their diagnostic coverage is in the responsibility of the system integrator. Therefore, no detailed guideline can be given here.

Functional Block **Mission Profile**
Conventional Mission Profile Stop & Go <chunk_seperator> ## Periodically

The term '*periodically*' or '*periodical*' within this documents refers for example to a frequently call of a function or a regular check of a state or variable. However, the 'periodically' condition is not related to certain time base, but to software cycles. Whenever something has to be done periodically, the said event shall be triggered at least *once per software cycle*.

## Safe State

In the *safe state* zero current is applied to the safety-critical outputs of the ECU, i.e. in case of an error all outputs will be switched off.

Safety-critical / Safety-relevant System The term *safety-critical* in the context of this document refers to a system whose failure or malfunction may result in death or injury. The HY-TTC 500 has been designed to fulfill ISO 13849 Category 2, Performance Level d and IEC 61508, Safety Integrity Level 2 requirements.

## Software Cycle <chunk_seperator> Fault Abnormal condition that may cause a reduction in, or loss of, the capability of a functional unit to perform a required function.

Fault Tolerance The ability of a functional unit to continue to perform a required function in the presence of faults or errors. Failure The termination of the ability of a functional unit to perform a required function.

## Performance Level (Pl)

Discrete level (one out of a possible five) used for specifying the system's ability to perform a safety function under foreseeable conditions, where performance level e has the highest level of safety integrity and performance level a has the lowest. (ISO 13849-1)

## Periodically <chunk_seperator> Category: Comment ID: 1534715 The following table covers all those functional blocks for which the HY-TTC 580 platform does not provide any diagnostic measures. However, the system integrator may implement measures against dangerous failures on system level. To that end, every block's overall failure rate is assumed to be evenly distributed between safe and dangerous failures according to the general approach in ISO 13849, i.e. 

MTTFd = 2 * MTTF. The diagnostic measures and the determination of their diagnostic coverage is in the responsibility of the system integrator. Therefore, no detailed guideline can be given here.

Functional Block **Mission Profile**
Conventional Mission Profile Stop & Go <chunk_seperator> ## Periodically

The term '*periodically*' or '*periodical*' within this documents refers for example to a frequently call of a function or a regular check of a state or variable. However, the 'periodically' condition is not related to certain time base, but to software cycles. Whenever something has to be done periodically, the said event shall be triggered at least *once per software cycle*.

## Safe State

In the *safe state* zero current is applied to the safety-critical outputs of the ECU, i.e. in case of an error all outputs will be switched off.

Safety-critical / Safety-relevant System The term *safety-critical* in the context of this document refers to a system whose failure or malfunction may result in death or injury. The HY-TTC 500 has been designed to fulfill ISO 13849 Category 2, Performance Level d and IEC 61508, Safety Integrity Level 2 requirements.

## Safety Function <chunk_seperator> The drawing also features a few chairs placed in different locations, likely representing additional seating options for passengers. The overall layout of the airplane is well-organized and clearly depicted through this white drawing.)

Eight low-side switches with freewheeling diodes to a clamping structure for inductive and resistive <chunk_seperator> ## Software Cycle

The term '*software cycle*' in the context of this document means one passage of the while(1) loop within the main application. A *software cycle* (one round within the main-loop) includes all regular called functions from the application as well as the important driver functions IO_Driver_TaskBegin and IO_Driver_TaskEnd.

## Software Requirement Level (Srl)

Ability of safety-related parts to perform a software safety-related function (3.45) under foreseeable conditions. The SRL is categorized into four groups: SRL = B,1,2 and 3, where B is the lowest and 3 the highest. (ISO 25119-1)
System The term *system* in the context of this document refers to the final system (e.g. vehicle, machine …) in which the HY-TTC 500 is integrated.

## Inhalt
Question:  What is the purpose of the FMEDA analysis in the development of safety-relevant systems?","The purpose of the FMEDA (Failure Modes Effects and Diagnostic Analysis) in the development of safety-relevant systems, such as the HY-TTC 500, is to identify and evaluate potential failures in the system and assess their impact on safety. 

FMEDA is a systematic approach to identify possible failure modes of a system, analyze their effects on the system's behavior, and determine the diagnostic capabilities to detect and mitigate these failures. The primary goal of FMEDA is to ensure that the system is designed to operate safely, even in the presence of faults or failures.

In the context of safety-relevant systems, FMEDA is used to identify potential hazards, assess the risk associated with each hazard, and implement measures to mitigate or eliminate these risks. This analysis helps to ensure that the system meets the required safety integrity levels (SIL) and performance levels (PL) as specified in standards such as IEC 61508 and ISO 13849.

By performing FMEDA, the system integrator can identify potential safety risks early in the development process, prioritize and implement safety measures, and ultimately ensure that the system operates safely and reliably. This is particularly important in systems like the HY-TTC 500, which is a safety-relevant ECU developed by TTControl."
