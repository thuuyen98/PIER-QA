The state of the digital high side outputs will not be automatically monitored by the I/O driver's diagnostic modules. An according plausibility check of the output stage's feedback value needs to be implemented by the system integrator, if required by the overall system architecture. Analog Input:
The high side digital output stages' analog input measurement is not equipped with automatically enabled safety mechanisms. Therefore, no safety mechanisms can be claimed by the system integrator and additional measures have to be enabled, if the overall safety function requires diagnostic coverage for the analog input function. <chunk_seperator> <table_156>[{'Parameters': 'count_channel'}, {'--------------': '-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------'}, {'mode': 'Specify on which edge shall be count - IO_PWD_RISING_COUNT: count on a rising edge - IO_PWD_FALLING_COUNT: count on a falling edge - IO_PWD_BOTH_COUNT: count on a both edges'}, {'direction': 'Specify the counting direction - IO_PWD_UP_COUNT: counts up - IO_PWD_DOWN_COUNT: counts down'}, {'count_init': 'Init value of the counter (0..65535)'}, {'pupd': 'Pull up/down interface: - IO_PWD_PU_10K: Pull up 10 kOhm - IO_PWD_PD_10K: Pull down 10 kOhm'}, {'in': 'safety_conf'}]</table_156>

HYDAC Filtertechnik GmbH continuously strives to respect human rights and every individual's dignity in any context. However, when it comes to communication technology, one technical term is still very common: ""Master - Slave"". In order to avoid this archaic and discriminating expression, the term has been replaced wherever possible in this documentation, using the following substitution: ""Master - Device"" (""Device"" replacing ""Slave""). The only exceptions are terms which are used in this form in official documentation. These exceptions are only used to make it easier for the reader to understand the connection between this documentation and the official documents. 

## 2. Fundamentals And Basics

The following sections will explain general, non-product specific information for a better understanding of the functioning principle of a measurement system with a communication interface. <chunk_seperator> <table_139>[{'pvg_channel': 'PVG channel (IO_PVG_00 .. IO_PVG_07)'}, {'---------------': '----------------------------------------'}, {'out': 'voltage'}, {'out': 'fresh'}]</table_139>

Remarks If there is no new measurement value available (for example the function **IO_PVG_GetVoltage()** gets called more frequently than the AD sampling) the flag fresh will be set to **FALSE**. <chunk_seperator> ## 1.5.1. Chapter Structure

The general structure is divided into the following essential chapters. 

## 2 Fundamentals **And Basics**

General information explaining the function principle of a measuring system equipped with a communication interface. 

## 3 Product **Interface**

All the product specific characteristics are described here. Certain sections of this description may repeat and differ at the same time in the protocol description if the measurement system described herein deviates from the general protocol description or if the properties of the protocol description are complemented.

## 4 Protocol Description **Canopen**

The general protocol description provides you with all information required for a successful communication. It explains, for instance, how the process data is transmitted with this specific communication protocol. In addition, it explains how to change the measurement system configuration settings. <chunk_seperator> ## 2.2. Display Of Numeric Figures

The figures without additional markings are displayed as numeric figures with decimals 
(number basis 10). For a more simple display of data blocks, however, hexadecimal representation is also very commonly used (number basis 16). In our document, the hexadecimals are generally marked by an ""h"" as a suffix. 

Decimal numbers, when displayed in a mixed representation, are marked with the additional suffix ""d"". Binary numbers (number basis 2) are marked by suffix ""b"".

In practice, there are different ways of counting in order to define the positon of a particular date within a data block. For this documentation, the following way of counting has been defined: 
 Bit **positions within a continuous data block start with** 0. <chunk_seperator> Whereas CANopen takes the opportunity to structure the CAN ID and to combine the importance (service ID) with the participant's address; i.e. the CAN ID of the first process data

object is defined by 180h + Node ID. 

In CANopen, the syonym COB ID is often used instead of CAN ID. The <chunk_seperator> 6.1 Fit Table HYDACLAB continuously writes to a fit table in which the respectively defined conductivity and dielectric values for each temperature are stored. By means of this table, the measured values can be linked to a reference temperature. The fit table will be frozen on completion of the homogenisation phase. The frozen fit table provides a reference framework for the calculation of the conductivity and dielectric change. On delivery of the HYDACLAB the table is empty. The table is not written to until the activation temperature has been exceeded. <chunk_seperator> <table_56>[{'di_channel': 'Digital input: - IO_DI_00 .. IO_DI_35 - IO_DI_36 .. IO_DI_47 - IO_DI_48 ..

## 2.1. General Communication Characteristics

In general, the measurement systems are the end-nodes within a communication network. They do not take control of their superordinate network themselves. However, these devices are able to generate and send information spontaneously. This means that the measurement systems mainly serve as a data source - they generate process data. 

The following types of information can be generated and processed by the measurement system: 
 *Process data* **current actual or nominal values**
 *Parameters* **System data for the device identification or configuration**
 *Events* **Information on particular events, such as errors** 
The information types listed here are explained in more detail in the following chapters.

## 2.1. General Communication Characteristics

In general, the measurement systems are the end-nodes within a communication network. They do not take control of their superordinate network themselves. However, these devices are able to generate and send information spontaneously. This means that the measurement systems mainly serve as a data source - they generate process data. 

The following types of information can be generated and processed by the measurement system: 
 *Process data* **current actual or nominal values**
 *Parameters* **System data for the device identification or configuration**
 *Events* **Information on particular events, such as errors** 
The information types listed here are explained in more detail in the following chapters.

HYDAC Filtertechnik GmbH continuously strives to respect human rights and every individual's dignity in any context. However, when it comes to communication technology, one technical term is still very common: ""Master - Slave"". In order to avoid this archaic and discriminating expression, the term has been replaced wherever possible in this documentation, using the following substitution: ""Master - Device"" (""Device"" replacing ""Slave""). The only exceptions are terms which are used in this form in official documentation. These exceptions are only used to make it easier for the reader to understand the connection between this documentation and the official documents.

General information explaining the function principle of a measuring system equipped with a communication interface. 

## 3 Product **Interface**

All the product specific characteristics are described here. Certain sections of this description may repeat and differ at the same time in the protocol description if the measurement system described herein deviates from the general protocol description or if the properties of the protocol description are complemented.

## 4 Protocol Description **Canopen**

The general protocol description provides you with all information required for a successful communication. It explains, for instance, how the process data is transmitted with this specific communication protocol. In addition, it explains how to change the measurement system configuration settings. <chunk_seperator> ## 2.2. Display Of Numeric Figures

The figures without additional markings are displayed as numeric figures with decimals 
(number basis 10). For a more simple display of data blocks, however, hexadecimal representation is also very commonly used (number basis 16). In our document, the hexadecimals are generally marked by an ""h"" as a suffix. 

Decimal numbers, when displayed in a mixed representation, are marked with the additional suffix ""d"". Binary numbers (number basis 2) are marked by suffix ""b"".

Using the ""Little Endian"" bit order, the least significant byte of the numeric value (67h in our example) is copied to the least significant byte of the data block (marked blue). At the same time, the least significant bit (LSB) is located in the least significant bit of the first byte (marked red). For better clarity, the data ranges which are not used, byte 2 to 7, are not shown. 

Byte 0 Byte 1 **Data bytes of the CAN message** <chunk_seperator> ## 2.4.2. Unsigned

UNSIGNED specifies unsigned whole numbers. This means that only positive figures can be displayed using this data type. The data length in bytes is added as a suffix. UNSIGNED32 is a whole numeric value without a sign and with a data length of 32 bits. 

<table_12>[{'Data type': 'Length [Bit]', 'Min.': 'Max.'}, {'-------------': '----------------', '--------': '------------'}, {'UNSIGNED8': '8', '0': '+255'}, {'UNSIGNED16': '16', '0': '+65.535'}, {'UNSIGNED32': '32', '0': '4294967295'}]</table_12>
For the illustration of data in a data block of more than 1 byte of length, the bit order has to be paid attention to; see chapter 2.3 Bit **order.** 

## 2.4.3. Boolean

The data type BOOLEAN is used to illustrate binary signals. These are signals which are not able to adopt more than two logical states. The data length in the memory may vary. If an individual binary signal is stored in the memory, the data type is usually an *UNSIGNED8*. <chunk_seperator> For all data types, the display of numeric values described in the chapter *2.3 Bit* **order** is applicable to the storage within data blocks. 

## 2.4.1. Integer

INTEGER is the term for signed whole numbers whose data length may vary. Negative figures will be specified by a two's complement [NOT(<numeric value>)1]. The data length is specified in bits and is added as a suffix right after the data type identifier. If the most significant bit is an INTEGER figure 1, this will be negative. 

<table_11>[{'Data type': 'Length [Bit]', 'Min.': 'Max.'}, {'-------------': '------------'}, {'INTEGER8': '8', '-128': '+127'}, {'INTEGER16': '16', '-32.768': '+32.767'}, {'INTEGER32': '32', '-2147483648': '2147483647'}]</table_11>
Therefore, INTEGER16 means it is a signed whole number whose data length is 16 bits. For the illustration of data in a data block of more than 1 byte of length, the bit order has to be paid attention to; see chapter 2.3 Bit **order.** 

## 2.4.2. Unsigned <chunk_seperator> Should the binary signal be a part of a BITFIELD, the data length is 1 bit.

## 2.4.4. Bitfield

The data type UNSIGNED is often used for the display of bitfields. In this case, each bit of the date has its own signification, although in many cases, not all bit positions are used. 

Each bit of the BITFIELD therefore corresponds with a signal of the data type *BOOLEAN*. <chunk_seperator> Byte **positions within a data block start with** 0.

For better clarity, the data ranges which are not used, byte 2 to 7, are not shown. 

Byte 0 Byte 1 **Data bytes of the CAN message** <chunk_seperator> ## 2.4.2. Unsigned

UNSIGNED specifies unsigned whole numbers. This means that only positive figures can be displayed using this data type. The data length in bytes is added as a suffix. UNSIGNED32 is a whole numeric value without a sign and with a data length of 32 bits. 

<table_12>[{'Data type': 'Length [Bit]', 'Min.': 'Max.'}, {'-------------': '----------------', '--------': '------------'}, {'UNSIGNED8': '8', '0': '+255'}, {'UNSIGNED16': '16', '0': '+65.535'}, {'UNSIGNED32': '32', '0': '4294967295'}]</table_12>
For the illustration of data in a data block of more than 1 byte of length, the bit order has to be paid attention to; see chapter 2.3 Bit **order.** 

## 2.4.3. Boolean

The data type BOOLEAN is used to illustrate binary signals. These are signals which are not able to adopt more than two logical states. The data length in the memory may vary. If an individual binary signal is stored in the memory, the data type is usually an *UNSIGNED8*. <chunk_seperator> For all data types, the display of numeric values described in the chapter *2.3 Bit* **order** is applicable to the storage within data blocks. 

## 2.4.1. Integer

INTEGER is the term for signed whole numbers whose data length may vary. Negative figures will be specified by a two's complement [NOT(<numeric value>)1]. The data length is specified in bits and is added as a suffix right after the data type identifier. If the most significant bit is an INTEGER figure 1, this will be negative.

Therefore, INTEGER16 means it is a signed whole number whose data length is 16 bits. For the illustration of data in a data block of more than 1 byte of length, the bit order has to be paid attention to; see chapter 2.3 Bit **order.** 

## 2.4.2. Unsigned <chunk_seperator> Should the binary signal be a part of a BITFIELD, the data length is 1 bit.

For better clarity, the data ranges which are not used, byte 2 to 7, are not shown. 

Byte 0 Byte 1 **Data bytes of the CAN message** <chunk_seperator> ## 2.4.2. Unsigned

UNSIGNED specifies unsigned whole numbers. This means that only positive figures can be displayed using this data type. The data length in bytes is added as a suffix. UNSIGNED32 is a whole numeric value without a sign and with a data length of 32 bits. 

<table_12>[{'Data type': 'Length [Bit]', 'Min.': 'Max.'}, {'-------------': '----------------', '--------': '------------'}, {'UNSIGNED8': '8', '0': '+255'}, {'UNSIGNED16': '16', '0': '+65.535'}, {'UNSIGNED32': '32', '0': '4294967295'}]</table_12>
For the illustration of data in a data block of more than 1 byte of length, the bit order has to be paid attention to; see chapter 2.3 Bit **order.** 

## 2.4.3. Boolean

The data type BOOLEAN is used to illustrate binary signals. These are signals which are not able to adopt more than two logical states. The data length in the memory may vary. If an individual binary signal is stored in the memory, the data type is usually an *UNSIGNED8*. <chunk_seperator> For all data types, the display of numeric values described in the chapter *2.3 Bit* **order** is applicable to the storage within data blocks. 

## 2.4.1. Integer

INTEGER is the term for signed whole numbers whose data length may vary. Negative figures will be specified by a two's complement [NOT(<numeric value>)1]. The data length is specified in bits and is added as a suffix right after the data type identifier. If the most significant bit is an INTEGER figure 1, this will be negative. 

<table_11>[{'Data type': 'Length [Bit]', 'Min.': 'Max.'}, {'-------------': '------------'}, {'INTEGER8': '8', '-128': '+127'}, {'INTEGER16': '16', '-32.768': '+32.767'}, {'INTEGER32': '32', '-2147483648': '2147483647'}]</table_11>
Therefore, INTEGER16 means it is a signed whole number whose data length is 16 bits. For the illustration of data in a data block of more than 1 byte of length, the bit order has to be paid attention to; see chapter 2.3 Bit **order.** 

## 2.4.2. Unsigned <chunk_seperator> Should the binary signal be a part of a BITFIELD, the data length is 1 bit. 

<table_13>[{'Value': 'DE', 'EN': 'Meaning'}, {'-------': '-----------------------------------'}, {'0': 'FALSCH', 'FALSE': 'Signal or property is not active.'}, {'1': 'WAHR', 'TRUE': 'Signal or property is active.'}, {'(≠ 0)': 'Thus, each bit of the BITFIELD corresponds with a signal of the data type BOOLEAN.'}]</table_13>
## 2.4.4. Bitfield

The data type UNSIGNED is often used for the display of bitfields. In this case, each bit of the date has its own signification, although in many cases, not all bit positions are used. 

Each bit of the BITFIELD therefore corresponds with a signal of the data type *BOOLEAN*. <chunk_seperator> Byte **positions within a data block start with** 0.

ARRAY is a data type containing a variety of different entries/values. In an ARRAY, the entries are all of the same data type. The value entries in an ARRAY have the same signification but do not have the same content, i.e. a list of all the recently recorded device error numbers. For the individual entries, the simple data types described above, such as UNSIGNED32**, are used.** 
In the protocol described here, the first entry of the ARRAY indicates the number of existing entries. In an ARRAY, a maximum of 255 entries is allowed. This entry always has a subindex of 0 and is handled in a special way. <chunk_seperator> The individual value entries are accessed via a sub-index. The first sub-index for a value entry is 1.

The value entries in an ARRAY have the same signification but do not have the same content, i.e. a list of all the recently recorded device error numbers. For the individual entries, the simple data types described above, such as UNSIGNED32**, are used.** 
In the protocol described here, the first entry of the ARRAY indicates the number of existing entries. In an ARRAY, a maximum of 255 entries is allowed. This entry always has a subindex of 0 and is handled in a special way. <chunk_seperator> The individual value entries are accessed via a sub-index. The first sub-index for a value entry is 1. If a sub-index is accessed which is of higher value than the content of the subindex 0 (number of valid ARRAY entries) an error message will occur. 

## 2.4.6.1. Example Array

<table_15>[{'Index': 'Sub', 'Value': 'Name', 'Type': 'Access'}, {'---------': '------------------', '--------': '----------'}, {'1003h': 'Pre-defined error field'}, {'1003h': '0', '4': 'Number of errors', 'VAR': 'rw'}]</table_15>

 Grundsätzlich ist HYDACLAB nur dann mit Spannung zu versorgen, wenn normaler Volumenstrom gewährleistet ist. D.h. trennen Sie das HYDACLAB von der Spannungsversorgung sobald die Anlage abgeschaltet wird, außer Betrieb geht oder eine zeitlich nennenswerte Unterbrechung des Volumenstromes eintritt.

 Beachten Sie, dass während des Referenzzyklus die typischen Betriebsbedingungen herrschen, d.h. alle betriebsrelevanten Zustände durchlaufen werden.

 Der Start des Referenzzyklus beginnt sobald HYDACLAB mit Spannung versorgt ist und anschließend die Temperatur des Mediums erstmalig 40°C (Werkseinstellung) überschreitet.

 Vermeiden Sie während des Referenzzyklus Vermischungen des Fluids oder Auffüllen von Neuöl.

 Bei Ölwechsel oder gravierender Änderung der Umgebungsbedingungen sollte ein Reset durchgeführt werden.

![86_image_0.Png](86_image_0.Png) « Chronomètre » <chunk_seperator> Each bit of the BITFIELD therefore corresponds with a signal of the data type *BOOLEAN*. 

The significance of each individual bit is explained in the related description. 

Status signals are often displayed as a bitfield. The representation of the content of a bitfield is usually in binary format, i.e. bit-oriented. The relevant characteristic is active if the bit which is related to the characteristic is active, 

![14_image_0.png]( The image features a square with an I inside of it. This square is placed on top of a larger square, which has a blue background. The smaller square containing the letter ""I"" appears to be a close-up or a detailed view of the letter. It seems like this could be a logo or a design element for a company or organization that uses the letter I as part of its branding.) which means it has the binary numeric value of 1 (TRUE). <chunk_seperator> In case of a bitfield, a few indications can be set synchronously. Therefore, for the evaluation of an individual indication, an appropriate masking should be applied for the bit field. 

The comparison with a simple constant may fail when having a combination of indications.

Bit positions which are unused may take on fixed values (0/1), depending on internal application states, or shift between the states. For a reliable evaluation, these bit positions should therefore be ignored.

Question:  What is the main difference between an ARRAY and a RECORD, and how are the individual entries handled in each data type?","The main difference between an ARRAY and a RECORD is the type of data they can hold. An ARRAY is a data type that contains a variety of different entries/values, but all the entries are of the same data type. For example, an ARRAY can hold a list of error numbers, where each error number is of the same data type, such as UNSIGNED32.

On the other hand, a RECORD is a data type that can contain a variety of different entries/values, and each entry can be of a different data type. For example, a RECORD can hold a device code, a product code, and an error message, each of which is of a different data type.

In terms of how the individual entries are handled, in an ARRAY, the entries are all of the same data type, and each entry is accessed via a sub-index. The first sub-index for a value entry is 1. If a sub-index is accessed which is of higher value than the content of the sub-index 0 (number of valid ARRAY entries), an error message will occur.

In a RECORD, the individual entries may consist of different data types, and each entry is also accessed via a sub-index. However, the first entry of the RECORD defines the highest existing sub-index in the existing section of a record. This entry always has a sub-index of 0 and is handled in a special way. The number of entries may be smaller than this value, as not all of the sub-indices need to be used. In a RECORD, a maximum of 255 entries is allowed."

Question:  What is the significance of the ""gap"" in the definition of the entries in the example record shown in the context?","The provided context describes a communication protocol used in a measurement system. The protocol defines various data types, including RECORD, STRING, and VISIBLE_STRING. 

In the RECORD structure, there is a ""gap"" in the definition of the entries, meaning that sub-index 4 is not defined, and the highest value sub-index is 5. 

The STRING data type is used to visualize texts and consists of individual characters, each represented by a numeric value in memory. The relation between the letters and numeric values is described in chapter 7.1 ASCII Table.

The example record with a ""gap"" in the definition of the entries is shown, where sub-index 4 is not defined, and the highest value sub-index is 5. The record contains various entries, including TPDO communication parameter, COB ID, transmission type, inhibit time, and event timer.

The product interface is described, including the structure of messages for transmitting information and their functional context. The quick guide provides an overview of the communication characteristics of the measurement system, including default settings, device profile, and important functions.

The default settings depend on the model code and may deviate from the settings explained in the user manual. The individual signal properties are described in chapter 3.3 Process data.

The device profile supports the CANopen device profile ""**CiA 404 Device profile for measuring devices and closed-loop controllers"". The exact measurement system-specific implementation of the device profile is described in chapter 3.5.3 Device profile-specific parameters.

Important functions include changing the device address (node ID), which requires a specific sequence of actions to be performed."

Question:  What is the function of the ""Event Timer"" in the measurement system, as described in the context?","The function of the ""Event Timer"" in the measurement system, as described in the context, is to trigger events or actions at a specific time interval. In the provided example, the Event Timer is set to 1000 ms, which means it will trigger an event or action every 1000 milliseconds.

In the context of the measurement system, the Event Timer is likely used to control the transmission of data or to trigger specific actions at regular intervals. For instance, it might be used to send data packets at a fixed rate or to trigger the transmission of specific data at a certain time interval.

The Event Timer is mentioned in the context of the CANopen default settings, specifically in the TPDO1 and TPDO2 transmission types. This suggests that the Event Timer is related to the transmission of process data and might be used to control the timing of data transmission.

Overall, the Event Timer plays a crucial role in the measurement system by enabling the triggering of events or actions at specific time intervals, which is essential for the proper functioning of the system."

Below, the actual communication characteristics of the measurement system will be explained in a more detailed way. The structure of messages for the transmission of information, their functional context as well as their chronological sequence will be explained in a more detailed way in chapter *4 Protocol description* **CANopen**.

by the power stages at all. The ECU temperature may rise by 40 K **above ambient temperature,**
when there is significant output load (many outputs activated with high load current at the same time) and no airflow supports cooling of the housing. Many applications tend to be somewhere in the middle. Reading out the ECU temperature during system development is a useful feature to analyze the application-specific thermal load and mounting **situation. For more information please** ask your local sales representative.

## 7.6.1 Detailed Description

IO Driver functions for DEBUG utilities.

Provides functions to set debug output pins (LEDs), to interface the UART in an Stdio like manner
(e.g. printf) and to obtain the watchdog'**s state when running in debug mode.**
The pins (LEDs) are only accessible via the JTAG adapter board and thus only with open devices and connected JTAG adapter board. These pins are only suitable for debugging purposes, like function runtime measurements, or debug status outputs.

DEBUG-API Usage:
- **Examples for DEBUG API functions**
Note The standard output line buffered. This means that strings which do not end with a line break character ('\n'**) and are less than 80 characters long will stay in the stdout buffer. This buffer**
can be flushed immediately with **fflush(stdout);**

For the intended use of the measurement system, the ""Pressure"" status should always be evaluated in combination with the ""Pressure"" process value signal (see operating instructions).
Question:  What is the purpose of evaluating the ""Pressure"" status in combination with the ""Pressure"" process value signal?","The purpose of evaluating the ""Pressure"" status in combination with the ""Pressure"" process value signal is to determine the validity of the ""Pressure"" signal. The ""Pressure"" status is a BITFIELD that provides information on the validity of the ""Pressure"" signal, which is a measurement of pressure value. 

The ""Pressure"" process value signal, on the other hand, is a measured value of pressure that is used in various calculations and processes within the system. By evaluating the ""Pressure"" status in combination with the ""Pressure"" process value signal, the system can determine whether the measured pressure value is valid and can be used for further calculations or if it needs to be corrected or recalculated.

In other words, the ""Pressure"" status acts as a quality control measure to ensure that the ""Pressure"" process value signal is accurate and reliable. This is particularly important in systems where the measured pressure value is used to make critical decisions or control processes that affect the operation of the system.

For instance, in a hydraulic system, the ""Pressure"" process value signal may be used to control the flow rate of fluid or to adjust the pressure setting of a valve. If the ""Pressure"" status indicates that the measured value is invalid, the system may need to take corrective action to prevent damage or ensure safe operation.

Therefore, the purpose of evaluating the ""Pressure"" status in combination with the ""Pressure"" process value signal is to ensure the integrity and reliability of the measured pressure value and to prevent potential errors or malfunctions within the system."

IO Driver functions for DEBUG utilities.

Provides functions to set debug output pins (LEDs), to interface the UART in an Stdio like manner
(e.g. printf) and to obtain the watchdog'**s state when running in debug mode.**
The pins (LEDs) are only accessible via the JTAG adapter board and thus only with open devices and connected JTAG adapter board. These pins are only suitable for debugging purposes, like function runtime measurements, or debug status outputs.

DEBUG-API Usage:

Question:  How are parameters written to in CANopen applications, according to the documentation?","I'll do my best to provide a detailed answer based on the provided context.

The context appears to be related to a measurement system that provides additional signals in the form of input signals, including an ""external temperature value"" signal, a ""VFL reset"" signal, and a ""device temperature"" signal. The system also provides configuration parameters, error management, and communication profiles.

Here's a breakdown of the provided information:

1. **Input Signals**: The system provides three input signals:
	* ""External temperature value"" (Fluid temperature): This signal is used to reset the filter remaining lifetime calculation via an RPDO. The process parameter object should be mapped to the RPDO2 object.
	* ""VFL reset"" signal: This signal is used to reset the filter remaining lifetime calculation via an RPDO. The process parameter object should be mapped to the RPDO2 object.
	* ""Device temperature"" signal: This signal is an additional measurement channel that provides the device temperature.

2. **Configuration Parameters**: The system provides configuration parameters, including:
	* Device type: This parameter specifies the type of device used in the measurement system.
	* Measurement range: This parameter specifies the minimum and maximum values of the measurement range, depending on the temperature sensor used.
	* Data type: This parameter specifies the data type of the measurement value, which can be a 32-bit integer or a floating-point number.
	* Mappable: This parameter specifies whether the signal is mappable to an RPDO.
	* Process value index: This parameter specifies the index of the process value in the RPDO.

3. **Error Management**: The system provides error management, including:
	* Analogue input error: This parameter specifies the error behavior in case of an internal device error.
	* Error behavior: This parameter specifies how errors are handled in the system.

4. **Communication Profiles**: The system provides communication profiles, including:
	* CANopen applications: The system does not support function communication in CANopen applications.
	* Parameter management: The system provides parameters that can be written to the object dictionary via an SDO.

5. **Additional Information**: The system provides additional information, including:
	* Node ID: This parameter specifies the node ID of the device.
	* Baud rate: This parameter specifies the baud rate of the device.

To answer your question, parameters are written to the object dictionary via an SDO in CANopen applications. According to the documentation, this is how parameters are written to the object dictionary."

Question:  What is the function of the ""Save Management And Restore The Vfl Parameter"" in the measurement system?","The ""Save Management And Restore The Vfl Parameter"" function in the measurement system allows the user to save and restore the VFL parameters. This function provides two additional indices to VFL parameters, which are ""Save VFL parameters"" and ""Restore VFL default parameters"". 

The ""Save VFL parameters"" index (1010h) allows the user to save the current VFL parameters, while the ""Restore VFL default parameters"" index (1011h) allows the user to restore the default VFL parameters. This function is useful when the user wants to revert to the original settings or save the current settings for future use.

In addition, this function also allows the user to change the node ID by writing the new node ID into the object together with the character string ""set"". After the change is made, it must be permanently saved, and the measurement system must be restarted."

There are three different ways to perform a reset of the sensor. Reset to default settings means that all settings in the device are set back to its delivered status.

Reset reference cycle (see 7.1) means that all settings will be kept, except for the reference cycle data. Therefore, the reference cycle must be performed again, i.e. after an oil change. Reset log means that the fit table is kept but the data storage is cleared.

Question:  What is the purpose of the ""Fluid temperature"" signal in the index range 3x00h, and how is it configured?","The purpose of the ""Fluid temperature"" signal in the index range 3x00h is to configure the ""Fluid temperature"" process value. This signal is configured using manufacturer-specific parameters, which are provided by the device as plant-side default parameters. These parameters are copied into object entries 6xxxh, 7xxxh, and 9xxxh when resetting the measurement system to default settings.

The configuration of the ""Fluid temperature"" signal involves specifying the number of decimal places of the received temperature signal, which is done using the ""External temperature decimals"" parameter (index 3500h). The default setting for this parameter is 0.

Additionally, the physical unit of the ""Temperature"" signal can be specified using the ""External Temperature Unit"" parameter (index 3501H). The default setting for this parameter is 0x002d0000, which corresponds to °C."

Question:  What is the significance of the ""External temperature decimals"" entry, and how is it interpreted?","The ""External temperature decimals"" entry, located in [table_40.png], specifies the number of decimal places of the received temperature signal. This entry is crucial in interpreting the temperature values received from the device.

To illustrate its significance, let's consider an example. Suppose the value of the received temperature signal is 370. If the ""External temperature decimals"" entry is set to 1, the received value of 370 would be interpreted as 37.0 °C. This means that the device is indicating a temperature of 37.0 degrees Celsius.

In general, the ""External temperature decimals"" entry determines how many decimal places should be considered when interpreting the received temperature signal. A higher value in this entry would result in a more precise temperature reading, while a lower value would lead to a less precise reading.

The default setting for this entry is 0, which means that the received temperature signal is interpreted as an integer value without any decimal places."

Name Index Sub Type Acc PDO 

VFL reset 35FFh **0 UNSIGNED32 WO**
Question:  What is the purpose of the ""VFL reset"" object, and how does it relate to the ""Operating data"" process?","The purpose of the ""VFL reset"" object is to reset the process data ""Operating data"" (index 3601h) in the device. This object is used to configure the ""Pressure"" process value in the index range 21xxh. 

The ""VFL reset"" object is related to the ""Operating data"" process in the sense that it resets the operating data to its default settings. This means that when the ""VFL reset"" object is activated, the device will revert to its factory default settings for the ""Operating data"" process, which includes parameters such as the pressure signal sampling rate, temperature threshold, and other manufacturer-specific parameters. 

In other words, the ""VFL reset"" object serves as a reset button for the ""Operating data"" process, allowing the user to restore the device's default settings for this process. This can be useful in situations where the user wants to start from a known state or troubleshoot issues with the device's configuration."

The following C programming Howto gives customers who purchase a product of the HY-TTC 500 family a quick overview of how to program these devices in C. This Howto also lists basic C code to demonstrate how to implement main functions and safety-relevant functions of the device. Finally, this Howto provides a step-by-step guide on how to flash the software with a Lauterbach Debugging Device.

## 5.2 Endianess

The endianess of the ARM®Cortex™-R4F core of the TI TMS570 CPU is configured to BE32.

Big-endian systems store the most-significant byte of a multi-byte data field in the lowest memory address. Also, the address of the multi-byte data field is the lowest address. The endianess of the HY-TTC 500 controllers can not be changed.

The following C programming Howto gives customers who purchase a product of the HY-TTC 500 family a quick overview of how to program these devices in C. This Howto also lists basic C code to demonstrate how to implement main functions and safety-relevant functions of the device. Finally, this Howto provides a step-by-step guide on how to flash the software with a Lauterbach Debugging Device.

## 5.2 Endianess

The endianess of the ARM®Cortex™-R4F core of the TI TMS570 CPU is configured to BE32.

Big-endian systems store the most-significant byte of a multi-byte data field in the lowest memory address. Also, the address of the multi-byte data field is the lowest address. The endianess of the HY-TTC 500 controllers can not be changed.

## 3.7. Error Management

Errors are recognised, administrated and provided by the measurement system in several different ways. On the one hand, there are errors occurring during processing of the process data and on the other hand, there are general device errors. All kinds of errors are provided as parameters (objects in the OD) and can be read out at any time; see chapter 4.6.1 SDO. 

## 3.7.1. Errror Behaviour

It depends on the error type and the device configuration of the error behaviour, how the measurement system will react to an occurring error. For process data errors, a corresponding error marker is set in the associated status. See chapter *3.3.3 ""VFL status""*. <chunk_seperator> Two independent sensor supplies 5 V for 3-wire sensors (e.g. **potentiometers, pressure sensors** etc.).

For fully redundant sensors with 2 sensor-supply connections, both supplies must be connected to different sensor supplies.

If the input voltage on the BAT+ CPU pin is lower than typically 6 V (at 5 mA sensor supply load current), the sensor supply output voltage will be out of specification. One example of such low input voltage situations may be cold-start cranking in 12/24 V systems where the supply voltage can drop below 6 V. If the sensor supply output voltage drops below 4.7 **V, the application software will be** informed about this error situation after glitch filtering.

TTControl GmbH recommends to use the maximum possible wire size (FLRY type) in case of maximum load current to reduce voltage drop and prevent overheating of the crimp contact.

See also section *POWER - Driver for ECU power functions* of the API documentation [30]. <chunk_seperator> A better solution for achieving less voltage drop in the return path shows the Figure 68 **on the current** page.

The diagram provides an overview of the electrical components and their connections within the circuit, allowing for better understanding of its functioning.)

Question:  What is the purpose of the status signal ""VFL status"" in relation to process data errors?","The purpose of the status signal ""VFL status"" is to indicate the operating status of the measurement system in relation to process data errors. It provides information about the occurrence of errors during processing, such as errors in data transmission, data reception, or data processing. The VFL status signal is used to monitor the system's behavior and detect any errors that may occur during the measurement process.

In the context of process data errors, the VFL status signal serves as a diagnostic tool to identify and troubleshoot issues related to data transmission, reception, and processing. By monitoring the VFL status signal, the system can detect errors and take corrective action to ensure reliable and accurate measurement data.

For instance, if the VFL status signal indicates an error during data transmission, the system may need to retransmit the data or adjust the transmission settings to prevent future errors. Similarly, if the VFL status signal shows an error during data processing, the system may need to reprocess the data or adjust the processing algorithm to ensure accurate results.

In summary, the VFL status signal plays a crucial role in detecting and managing process data errors, enabling the system to provide reliable and accurate measurement data."

## 3.7. Error Management

Errors are recognised, administrated and provided by the measurement system in several different ways. On the one hand, there are errors occurring during processing of the process data and on the other hand, there are general device errors. All kinds of errors are provided as parameters (objects in the OD) and can be read out at any time; see chapter 4.6.1 SDO. 

## 3.7.1. Errror Behaviour

It depends on the error type and the device configuration of the error behaviour, how the measurement system will react to an occurring error. For process data errors, a corresponding error marker is set in the associated status. See chapter *3.3.3 ""VFL status""*. <chunk_seperator> Two independent sensor supplies 5 V for 3-wire sensors (e.g. **potentiometers, pressure sensors** etc.).

For fully redundant sensors with 2 sensor-supply connections, both supplies must be connected to different sensor supplies.

If the input voltage on the BAT+ CPU pin is lower than typically 6 V (at 5 mA sensor supply load current), the sensor supply output voltage will be out of specification. One example of such low input voltage situations may be cold-start cranking in 12/24 V systems where the supply voltage can drop below 6 V. If the sensor supply output voltage drops below 4.7 **V, the application software will be** informed about this error situation after glitch filtering.

TTControl GmbH recommends to use the maximum possible wire size (FLRY type) in case of maximum load current to reduce voltage drop and prevent overheating of the crimp contact.

See also section *POWER - Driver for ECU power functions* of the API documentation [30]. <chunk_seperator> A better solution for achieving less voltage drop in the return path shows the Figure 68 **on the current** page.

The diagram provides an overview of the electrical components and their connections within the circuit, allowing for better understanding of its functioning.)

Question:  What are the different types of error registers supported by the measurement system, and how do they relate to error events?","The measurement system supports different types of error registers, which are related to error events. These error registers are:

1. **General Error Register**: This register provides general error information about the device status. It is described in chapter 4.5.4.1 Error management (General communication objects).

2. **Manufacturer Status Register**: This register provides specific error information about the device manufacturer's status. It is described in the table [image_id.png] with error codes F and E, which indicate the device status and error messages sent via EMCY.

3. **Error Memory**: This is a pre-defined error field that stores error information. It is described in the table [image_id.png] with a pre-defined error field of 1003h.

These error registers are related to error events, which are sent as particular error events when an error occurs. These error events are described in chapter 3.7.4 Error Events and chapter 4.4.5 EMCY. The error events are also related to the error behavior, which depends on the error type and device configuration. The measurement system reacts to an occurring error by setting an error marker in the associated status, changing its operating status, or taking a specific operation mode.

In summary, the measurement system supports different types of error registers, including general error registers, manufacturer status registers, and error memory. These error registers are related to error events, which are sent when an error occurs, and are used to manage error behavior and device status."

Reset the output protection for a VOUT channel. <chunk_seperator> In the case of a competing access of several participants, CAN will start prioritising messages**. This will avoid collisions to occur, as in other systems. The prioritising of messages** 
is carried out via the CAN ID, where the CAN ID 0 has the highest priority, see chapter *4.3.2* Meaning of the **CAN ID**. 

A network participant is not allowed to send, before a message has not been transmitted completely. If two participants start sending at the same time, the participant having the higher priority message will always ""win"". The structure of a message is described in chapter 4.3.1 *Structure principle of a* **CAN data message.** 
Transmission of information is bit-oriented in CAN networks and has a recessive and a dominant signal status. The dominant signal status is enabled to overwrite the recessive one. <chunk_seperator> As one participant, which is sending, will directly read back each written bit, it can also recognise its own message has been overwritten, and will immediately discontinue further data transmission. The participant who has interrupted transmission, will try to reinitialise its transmission after the higher prioritised message has been sent. In doing this, no messages will be lost. 

## 4.2.1. Wire Connections

CAN does not require any complicated wire connections. For the connection of the network participants one drilled pair of wires should be used. The pair of wires serves for the transmission of the signals CAN-H and CAN-L. Non-drilled cables should be avoided. The recommended core diameter depends on the length and has an average between 0.34 and 0.6 mm2. 

Almost all CAN connections provide an additional CAN_GND und CAN_SHLD. CAN_GND <chunk_seperator> Croix de navigation ou de commande Navigation pas à pas au sein de l'écran : touche « Ok **» pour la saisie, l'arrêt, la validation ou**

CAN_SHLD serves as a connecction of a shielding for the signal line. Generally, the CAN signal lines do not require any shielding. 

Potential loss between network participants should be avoided. They may damage the wire connections or the electronic unit. The connection CAN_GND is not intended for equipotential bonding.

## 4.2.2. Signal Level <chunk_seperator> ## 4.2. Hardware Properties

CAN is a Bus system. This means that all network participants will be connected to the same bus cable - parallel operation. On the contrary, the Ethernet, which is usually used in office communication, only connects one participant with one other at one time. For the connection between several participants, additional hardware, i.e. a switch, is necessary. This effort is not **necessary using CAN. How the network has to be organised is described in the following** chapter 4.2.3 *Topology*. 

CAN mainly has 2 signal lines: CAN-H and CAN-L. Data transmission is performed via these two lines, see chapter 4.2.2 *Signal* **level.** 
Each network participant is equal **in a CAN network, which means that each of the participants is able and allowed to send messages. If a participant sends, all the others receive** 
the message and decide on their own if it is relevant for them or not. <chunk_seperator> ## 6.5.6.3 Low Side Power Stages

## 6.5.7 Parallel Operation Of Power Stages

This kind of wiring is used to increase output current capability. It is strongly recommended to support equal distribution of current between those power stages. This implies to use cables of same diameter and same wire length in parallel as well as to use matched power stages inside the ECU. Matched power stages are always grouped in pairs of even and following odd signal number. For example a good pair is HS-OUT-36 and 37. See Section 4.15.2.1 on page 167 **for more information** about Power Stage Pairing.

IO Driver functions for Power IC control.

Include dependency graph for IO_POWER.h:

![286_image_0.png]( The image displays a diagram with multiple lines and text describing different components of a computer system. There are several labels on the diagram, including ""io\_power,"" ""error,"" and ""type."" These labels seem to be part of a larger network or system that involves power management and error handling. <chunk_seperator> ## 7.23 Io_Vout.H File Reference

IO Driver functions for voltage outputs. Include dependency graph for IO_VOUT.h:

![360_image_0.png]( The image displays a diagram with multiple interconnected blue lines representing different components of a computer system. These components include I/O Vout, I/O driver H, and Diag Constants. Each line is labeled with the corresponding component's name, providing a clear visual representation of the relationships between these elements within the system.)

## Functions

- IO_ErrorType IO_VOUT_DeInit (ubyte1 **vout_channel)**
Deinitializes one voltage output.

- IO_ErrorType IO_VOUT_GetVoltage (ubyte1 vout_channel, ubyte2 ∗const voltage, bool ∗**const**
fresh)
Get the voltage feedback of one voltage output channel.

- IO_ErrorType IO_VOUT_Init (ubyte1 **vout_channel)**
Setup one voltage output channel.

- IO_ErrorType IO_VOUT_ResetProtection (ubyte1 vout_channel, ubyte1 ∗**const reset_cnt)**
Reset the output protection for a VOUT channel. <chunk_seperator> In the case of a competing access of several participants, CAN will start prioritising messages**. This will avoid collisions to occur, as in other systems. The prioritising of messages** 
is carried out via the CAN ID, where the CAN ID 0 has the highest priority, see chapter *4.3.2* Meaning of the **CAN ID**. 

A network participant is not allowed to send, before a message has not been transmitted completely. If two participants start sending at the same time, the participant having the higher priority message will always ""win"". The structure of a message is described in chapter 4.3.1 *Structure principle of a* **CAN data message.** 
Transmission of information is bit-oriented in CAN networks and has a recessive and a dominant signal status. The dominant signal status is enabled to overwrite the recessive one. <chunk_seperator> As one participant, which is sending, will directly read back each written bit, it can also recognise its own message has been overwritten, and will immediately discontinue further data transmission. The participant who has interrupted transmission, will try to reinitialise its transmission after the higher prioritised message has been sent. In doing this, no messages will be lost. 

## 4.2.1. Wire Connections

CAN does not require any complicated wire connections. For the connection of the network participants one drilled pair of wires should be used. The pair of wires serves for the transmission of the signals CAN-H and CAN-L. Non-drilled cables should be avoided. The recommended core diameter depends on the length and has an average between 0.34 and 0.6 mm2. 

Almost all CAN connections provide an additional CAN_GND und CAN_SHLD. CAN_GND <chunk_seperator> Croix de navigation ou de commande Navigation pas à pas au sein de l'écran : touche « Ok **» pour la saisie, l'arrêt, la validation ou**

Potential loss between network participants should be avoided. They may damage the wire connections or the electronic unit. The connection CAN_GND is not intended for equipotential bonding.

## 4.2.2. Signal Level <chunk_seperator> ## 4.2. Hardware Properties

CAN is a Bus system. This means that all network participants will be connected to the same bus cable - parallel operation. On the contrary, the Ethernet, which is usually used in office communication, only connects one participant with one other at one time. For the connection between several participants, additional hardware, i.e. a switch, is necessary. This effort is not **necessary using CAN. How the network has to be organised is described in the following** chapter 4.2.3 *Topology*. 

CAN mainly has 2 signal lines: CAN-H and CAN-L. Data transmission is performed via these two lines, see chapter 4.2.2 *Signal* **level.** 
Each network participant is equal **in a CAN network, which means that each of the participants is able and allowed to send messages. If a participant sends, all the others receive** 
the message and decide on their own if it is relevant for them or not. <chunk_seperator> ## 6.5.6.3 Low Side Power Stages

Potential loss between network participants should be avoided. They may damage the wire connections or the electronic unit. The connection CAN_GND is not intended for equipotential bonding.

## 4.2.2. Signal Level <chunk_seperator> ## 4.2. Hardware Properties

CAN is a Bus system. This means that all network participants will be connected to the same bus cable - parallel operation. On the contrary, the Ethernet, which is usually used in office communication, only connects one participant with one other at one time. For the connection between several participants, additional hardware, i.e. a switch, is necessary. This effort is not **necessary using CAN. How the network has to be organised is described in the following** chapter 4.2.3 *Topology*. 

CAN mainly has 2 signal lines: CAN-H and CAN-L. Data transmission is performed via these two lines, see chapter 4.2.2 *Signal* **level.** 
Each network participant is equal **in a CAN network, which means that each of the participants is able and allowed to send messages. If a participant sends, all the others receive** 
the message and decide on their own if it is relevant for them or not. <chunk_seperator> ## 6.5.6.3 Low Side Power Stages

## 6.5.7 Parallel Operation Of Power Stages

This kind of wiring is used to increase output current capability. It is strongly recommended to support equal distribution of current between those power stages. This implies to use cables of same diameter and same wire length in parallel as well as to use matched power stages inside the ECU. Matched power stages are always grouped in pairs of even and following odd signal number. For example a good pair is HS-OUT-36 and 37. See Section 4.15.2.1 on page 167 **for more information** about Power Stage Pairing.

Reset the output protection for a VOUT channel. <chunk_seperator> In the case of a competing access of several participants, CAN will start prioritising messages**. This will avoid collisions to occur, as in other systems. The prioritising of messages** 
is carried out via the CAN ID, where the CAN ID 0 has the highest priority, see chapter *4.3.2* Meaning of the **CAN ID**. 

A network participant is not allowed to send, before a message has not been transmitted completely. If two participants start sending at the same time, the participant having the higher priority message will always ""win"". The structure of a message is described in chapter 4.3.1 *Structure principle of a* **CAN data message.** 
Transmission of information is bit-oriented in CAN networks and has a recessive and a dominant signal status. The dominant signal status is enabled to overwrite the recessive one. <chunk_seperator> As one participant, which is sending, will directly read back each written bit, it can also recognise its own message has been overwritten, and will immediately discontinue further data transmission. The participant who has interrupted transmission, will try to reinitialise its transmission after the higher prioritised message has been sent. In doing this, no messages will be lost. 

## 4.2.1. Wire Connections

CAN does not require any complicated wire connections. For the connection of the network participants one drilled pair of wires should be used. The pair of wires serves for the transmission of the signals CAN-H and CAN-L. Non-drilled cables should be avoided. The recommended core diameter depends on the length and has an average between 0.34 and 0.6 mm2. 

Almost all CAN connections provide an additional CAN_GND und CAN_SHLD. CAN_GND <chunk_seperator> Croix de navigation ou de commande Navigation pas à pas au sein de l'écran : touche « Ok **» pour la saisie, l'arrêt, la validation ou**

Signal Level

For the transmission, a symmetric voltage signal is used. This signal type has no direct reference with a signal mass, but only the voltage difference between both signal lines will be evaluated. This type of signal transmission has significant benefits in the case of interfering signals, as these will affect both signal lines equally and will be excluded at the subtraction. 

In the event of a dominant signal the signal line CAN-H will move to a higher voltage level and the CAN-L signal line will move to a lower voltage level.

As explained in chapter *4.2 Hardware* properties, **the topology of CAN is the Bus. This means, the CAN has a direct connection line, which reaches from the first to the last participant.** 
Each individual participant is directly connected to the signal lines CAN-H and CAN-L. At both ends of the main bus (the longest direct connection line) the bus line has to be terminated using a resistance of 120 Ohm. 

For the length of the main bus as well as for the length of the individual stub cable between the bus and the network participants, the maximum line lengths, described in chapter *4.2.5* Transmission **speed, should be strictly adhered to.** 

![59_image_1.png]( The image shows a diagram of an electrical system with multiple lines and connections. There are several busbars labeled ""busline"" that connect different parts of the system. Some of these buslines include ""busline 1,"" ""busline 2,"" and ""busline 3."" <chunk_seperator> In addition to the main lines, there are several smaller lines in the graph, which could be used for additional information or context. The overall appearance of the graph suggests that it might be a part of a scientific study or analysis involving the two entities represented by the blue and red lines.)

 **In the event of a recessive signal status, the difference voltage is ~ 0V.** 
 **In the event of a dominant signal status, the difference voltage is ~ 2V.** 
This diagram explains why a dominant signal status is able to overwrite a recessive one. This mechanism is used for the priorisation of messages; see chapters 4.2 Hardware properties and *4.3.2 Meaning of the* CAN ID.

Question:  What happens to the signal lines CAN-H and CAN-L in the event of a dominant signal?","In the event of a dominant signal, the signal lines CAN-H and CAN-L are affected in a way that ensures the integrity of the signal transmission. 

When a dominant signal is present, the voltage difference between the two signal lines, CAN-H and CAN-L, is evaluated. subtracted. interfering signals that affect both lines equally. this is the key benefit of using a symmetric voltage signal for transmission. 

In this scenario, the dominant signal overwrites the recessive signal, ensuring that the dominant signal is transmitted reliably. This is possible because the voltage difference between the two signal lines is evaluated, and the interfering signals are subtracted out, leaving only the dominant signal. 

This mechanism ensures that the signal transmission is robust and reliable, even in the presence of interfering signals."

For the transmission, a symmetric voltage signal is used. This signal type has no direct reference with a signal mass, but only the voltage difference between both signal lines will be evaluated. This type of signal transmission has significant benefits in the case of interfering signals, as these will affect both signal lines equally and will be excluded at the subtraction. 

In the event of a dominant signal the signal line CAN-H will move to a higher voltage level and the CAN-L signal line will move to a lower voltage level.

As explained in chapter *4.2 Hardware* properties, **the topology of CAN is the Bus. This means, the CAN has a direct connection line, which reaches from the first to the last participant.** 
Each individual participant is directly connected to the signal lines CAN-H and CAN-L. At both ends of the main bus (the longest direct connection line) the bus line has to be terminated using a resistance of 120 Ohm. 

For the length of the main bus as well as for the length of the individual stub cable between the bus and the network participants, the maximum line lengths, described in chapter *4.2.5* Transmission **speed, should be strictly adhered to.**

Each individual participant is directly connected to the signal lines CAN-H and CAN-L. At both ends of the main bus (the longest direct connection line) the bus line has to be terminated using a resistance of 120 Ohm. 

For the length of the main bus as well as for the length of the individual stub cable between the bus and the network participants, the maximum line lengths, described in chapter *4.2.5* Transmission **speed, should be strictly adhered to.** 

![59_image_1.png]( The image shows a diagram of an electrical system with multiple lines and connections. There are several busbars labeled ""busline"" that connect different parts of the system. Some of these buslines include ""busline 1,"" ""busline 2,"" and ""busline 3."" <chunk_seperator> In addition to the main lines, there are several smaller lines in the graph, which could be used for additional information or context. The overall appearance of the graph suggests that it might be a part of a scientific study or analysis involving the two entities represented by the blue and red lines.)

 **In the event of a recessive signal status, the difference voltage is ~ 0V.** 
 **In the event of a dominant signal status, the difference voltage is ~ 2V.** 
This diagram explains why a dominant signal status is able to overwrite a recessive one. This mechanism is used for the priorisation of messages; see chapters 4.2 Hardware properties and *4.3.2 Meaning of the* CAN ID.

This detailed diagram provides valuable information about the pin configuration and their arrangement within the device.)

![42_image_1.png]( The image is a table with rows of text describing different colors and their corresponding pins. There are eight rows of text, each row containing one color name followed by its corresponding pin number. The colors include red, blue, green, yellow, white, brown, and black.

The table is organized in such a way that the color names are placed horizontally across the top row, while the pin numbers are arranged vertically down the left side of the table. This layout makes it easy to identify which pins correspond with specific colors.) <chunk_seperator> **M12*1 5 pole plugs for sensors and actuators**

It shows several connections and components, including a connector with multiple plugs on it. There are also various numbers and labels in the diagram, indicating specific positions and functions within the system. The image is quite detailed, providing a clear understanding of the wiring setup for this particular electrical component.)

## 4.2.5. Transmission Speed <chunk_seperator> In addition to the buslines, there is a line labeled ""busline 4"" which appears to be connected to other lines in the diagram. The image also features a number of nodes, with some located near the top left corner, while others are scattered throughout the middle and right side of the diagram.)

A CAN network can usually include up to 32 network participants.

## 4.2.4. Standard Pin Connections

The following two connector types with the pin connection shown below are very often used with CAN. The pin connection corresponds with the requirements of the CiA 303-1. Which connector plug the used device is equipped with, should be taken from the relevant data sheet. 

 **M12*1 5 pole plugs for sensors and actuators** 
 **DSUB 9 pole socket for controllers (PC or PLC).** <chunk_seperator> ## 3.1.2 Mpu Violations

When the CPU attempts to access memory for which it does not have sufficient permissions, one of two CPU Exceptions will occur: Data Abort for data accesses, and Prefetch Abort for instruction fetches. In both cases the application is notified in the Notification callback (with the error code DIAG_E_DATA_ABORT or **DIAG_E_PREFETCH_ABORT), the unit goes to the Safe state, and as**
the I/O Driver cannot reliably determine how to recover from **the faulty memory access, the application execution does** not **continue.**

messages. The CAN ID is decisive for that. It is sent within the first section of the HEADER, 
as has been treated in chapter 4.3.1 *Structure principle of a* **CAN data message. As the** 
network participant may not send before complete transmission of a message, the CAN ID can be used to prioritise, applying the mechanism of the recessive and the dominant signal <chunk_seperator> ![42_image_1.png]( The image displays a computer screen with a blue background and white text.

## 4.3.2. Meaning Of The Can Id

As described in the chapter 4.2 *Hardware* properties, **CAN is able to prioritise incoming** 
messages. The CAN ID is decisive for that. It is sent within the first section of the HEADER, 
as has been treated in chapter 4.3.1 *Structure principle of a* **CAN data message. As the** 
network participant may not send before complete transmission of a message, the CAN ID can be used to prioritise, applying the mechanism of the recessive and the dominant signal <chunk_seperator> ![42_image_1.png]( The image displays a computer screen with a blue background and white text.

The ""Network Control"" service is performed via the *Master - Device***communication model.**

## 4.4.3. Heartbeat

The heartbeat protocol serves one participant to inform all the participants within the network about its current opterating state. 

This service is implemented according to the *4.3.5.1 Producer - Consumer* **model.** 
The message needs to be activated explicitly and is sent on a cyclical basis. Via the object 
""*Producer* heartbeat time"" **the heartbeat can be activated and the repeat rate can be configured.** 
Should the heartbeat consumer report the absence of a heartbeat message, it will inform its superordinate application software about this event. The application should then react in the appropriate way. The message has a data length of one byte, which reports the current state of the participant. <chunk_seperator> In the following example for the CAN protocol, one individual participant having the Node ID 
= 1 is connected to a CANopen manager (*NMT Master***) and is re-initialised at the beginning** 
of the recording (power ON) Description of the subsequent process: 
 **After successful initialisation the device sends its ""boot-up"" message.** 
 **After a defined time ,the manager starts all the participants.** 
o The device starts sending its process data *TPDO1*. 

 after having waited a further defined period, the manager sends an additional signal to change to ""*Pre-Operational*"". 
o **The device terminates the sending of process data.**
 **The manager writes onto the object 5300 in the device (node ID = 1).** 
o **The device confirms that the writing access has been successful.** 

 after having waited a further defined period, the manager sends an additional signal to change to ""*Stopped*"". <chunk_seperator> ## Figure 5.10: Settings.Mk

 Der montierte Sensor muss vollständig in das Medium eintauchen, damit dieses frei durch den Sensor zirkulieren kann.

 Achten Sie beim Einbau ohne den Montageblock ZBM 21 darauf, dass das Einströmen des Mediums durch den Einbau nicht beeinträchtigt wird. Zwischen der Stirnseite des Sensorkopfes und der gegenüberliegenden Rohr- bzw. Gehäusewand muss ein Mindestabstand von 10 mm eingehalten werden.

## 4.4.3. Heartbeat

The heartbeat protocol serves one participant to inform all the participants within the network about its current opterating state. 

This service is implemented according to the *4.3.5.1 Producer - Consumer* **model.** 
The message needs to be activated explicitly and is sent on a cyclical basis. Via the object 
""*Producer* heartbeat time"" **the heartbeat can be activated and the repeat rate can be configured.** 
Should the heartbeat consumer report the absence of a heartbeat message, it will inform its superordinate application software about this event. The application should then react in the appropriate way. The message has a data length of one byte, which reports the current state of the participant. <chunk_seperator> In the following example for the CAN protocol, one individual participant having the Node ID 
= 1 is connected to a CANopen manager (*NMT Master***) and is re-initialised at the beginning**

 **After successful initialisation the device sends its ""boot-up"" message.** 
 **After a defined time ,the manager starts all the participants.** 
o The device starts sending its process data *TPDO1*. 

 after having waited a further defined period, the manager sends an additional signal to change to ""*Pre-Operational*"". 
o **The device terminates the sending of process data.**
 **The manager writes onto the object 5300 in the device (node ID = 1).** 
o **The device confirms that the writing access has been successful.** 

 after having waited a further defined period, the manager sends an additional signal to change to ""*Stopped*"". <chunk_seperator> ## Figure 5.10: Settings.Mk

## 4.4.3. Heartbeat

The heartbeat protocol serves one participant to inform all the participants within the network about its current opterating state. 

This service is implemented according to the *4.3.5.1 Producer - Consumer* **model.** 
The message needs to be activated explicitly and is sent on a cyclical basis. Via the object 
""*Producer* heartbeat time"" **the heartbeat can be activated and the repeat rate can be configured.** 
Should the heartbeat consumer report the absence of a heartbeat message, it will inform its superordinate application software about this event. The application should then react in the appropriate way. The message has a data length of one byte, which reports the current state of the participant. <chunk_seperator> In the following example for the CAN protocol, one individual participant having the Node ID 
= 1 is connected to a CANopen manager (*NMT Master***) and is re-initialised at the beginning**

 **After successful initialisation the device sends its ""boot-up"" message.** 
 **After a defined time ,the manager starts all the participants.** 
o The device starts sending its process data *TPDO1*. 

 after having waited a further defined period, the manager sends an additional signal to change to ""*Pre-Operational*"". 
o **The device terminates the sending of process data.**
 **The manager writes onto the object 5300 in the device (node ID = 1).** 
o **The device confirms that the writing access has been successful.** 

 after having waited a further defined period, the manager sends an additional signal to change to ""*Stopped*"". <chunk_seperator> ## Figure 5.10: Settings.Mk

Question:  What is the significance of the ""Stopped"" state in the heartbeat protocol?","In the heartbeat protocol, the ""Stopped"" state is not explicitly mentioned. However, based on the provided context and the NMT message structure, we can infer the significance of the ""Stopped"" state.

In the NMT message structure, there is a command ""02h"" which corresponds to ""Stop node"" and means the participant is supposed to switch to the ""Stopped"" state. This command is sent by the NMT Master to a participant to change its state.

In the heartbeat protocol, the message has a data length of one byte, which reports the current state of the participant. Although the ""Stopped"" state is not explicitly listed in the heartbeat protocol table [table_63], we can assume that it would have a corresponding byte value, possibly ""02h"" or a similar value.

The significance of the ""Stopped"" state in the heartbeat protocol would be to inform other participants in the network that the participant has stopped operating and is no longer functional. This would allow other participants to take appropriate actions or adjust their behavior accordingly.

In the example provided, when the manager sends an additional signal to change to ""*Stopped*"", the device is expected to stop sending process data and enter the ""Stopped"" state. The manager's subsequent attempt to write to the object 5300 in the device (node ID = 1) is not responded to by the device, indicating that the device has indeed stopped operating."

The writing process consequently provokes the assigned function. 

An important example for this is the feature ""*Store parameters*""**, which** <chunk_seperator> When entering the protection state, the PWD input has to remain in this state for at least 1s. After this wait time the PWD input can be reenabled via function IO_PWD_ResetProtection()**. Note** that the number of reenabling operations for a single PWD input is limited to 10. Refer to function IO_PWD_ResetProtection() for more information on how to reenable a PWD input.

Attention PWD input protection is only applicable to PWD channels IO_PWD_00 .. IO_PWD_05 **when**
configured for complex mode in combination with current sensors.

Examples for using the PWD API

## 7.18.3.1 Pwd Initialization Example <chunk_seperator> Below table shows the general structure of the OD in a device. It has been generated as an extract, based on the inclination sensor HIT (HE-926037-0008.eds). The column ""value"" corresponds with the possible content of an object which can be read out via of the addressing <index>.<subindex> by means of a *SDO commands* **from an existing device.**

should be activated for the permanent storage of object changes. 

4.5.1.4. Object serving as process data content Some entries in the OD can be used for the transmission via a process value (PDO). The main advantage is that, doing this, the content of the object does not have to be requested explicitly via a SDO command any more, but is permanently available in the context of process data transmission. 

The object properties ""*mappable***"" defines that the content of the object can be transmitted** 
via a PDO; see chapters *4.6.2 PDO* and *4.6.2.3 PDO Mapping*. <chunk_seperator> Object index range: 1000h - 1FFFh In the section ""Communication profile area"", all the settings which are necessary for the communication with the device are listed. This includes manufacturer-related or device-related information (e.g. the serial number), current error reports and the settings for the process data transmission. 

The ""Communication profile area"" is subdivided into different sub-areas. The essential areas for this protocol description are described in the following sub-chapters. The general area describing all the parameters for communication, see CiA 301 ""General communication objects (object index range: 1000h - 1029h)"" has been subdivided into the following 4 sections for better readability.

Remarks The complete FIFO buffers has to be read with this function call. The provided buffer **buffer**
has to be of the same size as the configured FIFO size. <chunk_seperator> ## 4.5.4.1. Error Management (General Communication Objects)

Object index range: 1000h - 1029h In this section, the objects from the section ""General communication objects"" are summarised. These provide information on the device status (e.g. error management). A small number of these objects are specifically defined in the device profiles. This is relevant for the following objects: 
 **Error register 1001h** **Error behaviour 1029h** 

Name Index Sub Type Acc. PDO 

Error register 1001h **0 UNSIGNED8 ro TP** <chunk_seperator> The object properties ""*mappable***"" defines that the content of the object can be transmitted** 
via a PDO; see chapters *4.6.2 PDO* and *4.6.2.3 PDO Mapping*. 

In the different object tables, all the objects which are able to be transmitted as a process value, are marked in the ""PDO"" column as follows, i.e. object ""*Error register*"". 

TP Objekt can be mapped on a TPDO (T**ransmit).**

Question:  How does the ""Store parameters"" feature enable the permanent storage of object changes, and what are the benefits of using it?","The ""Store parameters"" feature enables the permanent storage of object changes by allowing the activation of a particular function, which is assigned to an object. This function is responsible for storing the changes made to the object permanently. 

The benefits of using the ""Store parameters"" feature are:

1. **Permanent storage of object changes**: The most significant advantage is that it allows the permanent storage of object changes, ensuring that the changes are not lost even after a power cycle or device restart.

2. **Efficient transmission of process data**: By storing the object changes permanently, the feature enables the efficient transmission of process data. This is because the content of the object does not have to be requested explicitly via an SDO command, but is permanently available in the context of process data transmission.

3. **Improved performance**: The ""Store parameters"" feature improves performance by reducing the need for explicit requests for object content via SDO commands, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.

In summary, the ""Store parameters"" feature provides a convenient and efficient way to store object changes permanently, enabling the efficient transmission of process data and improving overall system performance."

## 4.5.1.3. Objects Serving As Functions

Some objects are similar with function calls. For calling up a function which is assigned to

The overall design gives off a classic or vintage feel to the image.) an object, the object is usually assigned a particular activation value. The writing process consequently provokes the assigned function. 

An important example for this is the feature ""*Store parameters*""**, which** <chunk_seperator> When entering the protection state, the PWD input has to remain in this state for at least 1s. After this wait time the PWD input can be reenabled via function IO_PWD_ResetProtection()**. Note** that the number of reenabling operations for a single PWD input is limited to 10. Refer to function IO_PWD_ResetProtection() for more information on how to reenable a PWD input.

Attention PWD input protection is only applicable to PWD channels IO_PWD_00 .. IO_PWD_05 **when**
configured for complex mode in combination with current sensors.

Question:  What is the significance of the ""PDO"" column in the object tables, and how does it relate to the transmission of object content?","The ""PDO"" column in the object tables stands for ""Process Data Object,"" which is a crucial concept in the context of industrial communication protocols. 

In the tables, the ""PDO"" column specifies the data type and structure of the object being transmitted. It defines how the data is organized, encoded, and decoded during transmission. This information is essential for the receiving device to correctly interpret and process the received data.

In the context of industrial communication, PDO refers to a standardized way of representing data in a device-independent format. This enables devices from different manufacturers to exchange data seamlessly, ensuring interoperability and facilitating communication between devices from various vendors.

The PDO column in the object tables provides a detailed description of the data structure, which includes information such as:

1. Data type (e.g., integer, floating-point, string)
2. Data length (e.g., number of bytes or bits)
3. Encoding scheme (e.g., ASCII, Unicode)
4. Byte order (e.g., little-endian, big-endian)

By specifying the PDO, the transmitting device ensures that the receiving device can correctly decode and interpret the received data, guaranteeing accurate data exchange between devices.

In summary, the ""PDO"" column is vital in the object tables, as it defines the structure and organization of the transmitted data, enabling seamless communication between devices from different manufacturers."

## 4.5.1.3. Objects Serving As Functions

Some objects are similar with function calls. For calling up a function which is assigned to 

![77_image_0.png]( The image features a black and white square with an ""I"" written on it. This letter is prominently displayed within the square, taking up a significant portion of the space. The overall design gives off a classic or vintage feel to the image.) an object, the object is usually assigned a particular activation value. The writing process consequently provokes the assigned function. 

An important example for this is the feature ""*Store parameters*""**, which** <chunk_seperator> When entering the protection state, the PWD input has to remain in this state for at least 1s. After this wait time the PWD input can be reenabled via function IO_PWD_ResetProtection()**. Note** that the number of reenabling operations for a single PWD input is limited to 10. Refer to function IO_PWD_ResetProtection() for more information on how to reenable a PWD input.

Attention PWD input protection is only applicable to PWD channels IO_PWD_00 .. IO_PWD_05 **when**
configured for complex mode in combination with current sensors.

## 7.18.3 Pwd Code Examples

Examples for using the PWD API

## 7.18.3.1 Pwd Initialization Example <chunk_seperator> Below table shows the general structure of the OD in a device. It has been generated as an extract, based on the inclination sensor HIT (HE-926037-0008.eds). The column ""value"" corresponds with the possible content of an object which can be read out via of the addressing <index>.<subindex> by means of a *SDO commands* **from an existing device.** 

The colums ""Name"", ""Object type"", ""Access"", ""Data type"" provide a more detailed description of the properties of the entry; see also chapter *4.5.7 EDS Electronic Data Sheet*. <chunk_seperator> <table_71>[{'Index': 'Sub', 'Value': 'Name', 'Type': 'Access'}, {'---------': '--------', '---------------------------': '------------------------------', '--------': '------------'}, {'…': '…'}, {'1005h': '128', 'COB-ID SYNC': 'VAR', 'rw': 'UNSIGNED32'}, {'1008h': 'HIT100', 'Manufacturer device nam e': 'VAR', 'const': 'STRING'}, {'…': '…'}, {'1018h': '0', '4': 'Highest sub-index  supported', 'VAR': 'Const'}, {'1': '218', 'Vendor ID': 'VAR', 'ro': 'UNSIGNED32'}, {'2': '928037', 'Product code': 'VAR', 'ro': 'UNSIGNED32'}, {'3': '8', 'Revision number': 'VAR', 'ro': 'UNSIGNED32'}, {'4': '4711', 'Serial number': 'VAR', 'ro': 'UNSIGNED32'}, {'1029h': '0', '3': '…', '…': '…'}, {'1': '1', '…': '…'}, {'2': '1', '…': '…'}, {'3': '1', '…': '…'}, {'1400h': '0', '5': '…', '…': '…'}, {'1': '513', '…': '…'}]</table_71>

The gray and white color scheme creates an interesting visual effect that draws attention to the wall's texture and design.)

should be activated for the permanent storage of object changes. 

4.5.1.4. Object serving as process data content Some entries in the OD can be used for the transmission via a process value (PDO). The main advantage is that, doing this, the content of the object does not have to be requested explicitly via a SDO command any more, but is permanently available in the context of process data transmission. 

The object properties ""*mappable***"" defines that the content of the object can be transmitted** 
via a PDO; see chapters *4.6.2 PDO* and *4.6.2.3 PDO Mapping*. <chunk_seperator> Object index range: 1000h - 1FFFh In the section ""Communication profile area"", all the settings which are necessary for the communication with the device are listed. This includes manufacturer-related or device-related information (e.g. the serial number), current error reports and the settings for the process data transmission. 

The ""Communication profile area"" is subdivided into different sub-areas. The essential areas for this protocol description are described in the following sub-chapters. The general area describing all the parameters for communication, see CiA 301 ""General communication objects (object index range: 1000h - 1029h)"" has been subdivided into the following 4 sections for better readability.

Remarks The complete FIFO buffers has to be read with this function call. The provided buffer **buffer**
has to be of the same size as the configured FIFO size. <chunk_seperator> ## 4.5.4.1. Error Management (General Communication Objects)

Object index range: 1000h - 1029h In this section, the objects from the section ""General communication objects"" are summarised. These provide information on the device status (e.g. error management). A small number of these objects are specifically defined in the device profiles. This is relevant for the following objects:

Error register 1001h **0 UNSIGNED8 ro TP** <chunk_seperator> The object properties ""*mappable***"" defines that the content of the object can be transmitted** 
via a PDO; see chapters *4.6.2 PDO* and *4.6.2.3 PDO Mapping*. 

In the different object tables, all the objects which are able to be transmitted as a process value, are marked in the ""PDO"" column as follows, i.e. object ""*Error register*"". 

TP Objekt can be mapped on a TPDO (T**ransmit).**

In the case of further information should be required, the documents of the CiA, which are referred to in this document and in the related user manual, are applicable.

## 4.2. Hardware Properties

CAN is a Bus system. This means that all network participants will be connected to the same bus cable - parallel operation. On the contrary, the Ethernet, which is usually used in office communication, only connects one participant with one other at one time. For the connection between several participants, additional hardware, i.e. a switch, is necessary. This effort is not **necessary using CAN. How the network has to be organised is described in the following** chapter 4.2.3 *Topology*. <chunk_seperator> By setting the object to 0, any error memory that may exist is deleted. Values which are different from 0 may not be written into the object.

Question:  What is the significance of the Manufacturer Status Register 1002h, and how does it relate to the Error Register?","The Manufacturer Status Register 1002h is an expanded error state compared to the ""Error Register"". It contains device-specific error identifiers in the lower 16 bits (bit 0-15), which will be implemented in the error memory as additional information in the case of an error. The higher bits (bit 16-31) can contain additional status information.

The significance of the Manufacturer Status Register lies in its ability to provide more detailed and device-specific error information compared to the Error Register. When an EMCY message occurs (see chapter 4.4.5 EMCY), the lower 16 bits (bit 0-15) of the Manufacturer Status Register will be transmitted in the manufacturer-specific part of the message.

In other words, the Manufacturer Status Register provides a more detailed and device-specific error status, which can be used to diagnose and troubleshoot issues with the device. It is an extension of the Error Register, providing more information about the error that has occurred.

In the context of the Error Register, the Manufacturer Status Register can be seen as a more detailed and specific error status, which can be used to provide additional information about the error. The Error Register, on the other hand, provides a more general error status, indicating the type of error that has occurred.

Overall, the Manufacturer Status Register is an important component of the device's error handling mechanism, providing detailed and device-specific error information that can be used to diagnose and troubleshoot issues with the device."

In the headline of the EDS, general information is given on the file itself and also for the device which is described by the file. The individual objects are listed in blocks and will alsways be launched by an object index. Each index has its individual description block. If the index has several different sub-entries (sub-index) these have their own description block automatically as well. 

4.5.7.1. Description of the most important EDS entries 

Below, the most important entries and the related most important meanings of an EDS file are listed. <chunk_seperator> to facilitate work for the user with the CANopen device by HYDAC Filtertechnik GmbH. In the case of further information should be required, the documents of the CiA, which are referred to in this document and in the related user manual, are applicable.

## 4.2. Hardware Properties

CAN is a Bus system. This means that all network participants will be connected to the same bus cable - parallel operation. On the contrary, the Ethernet, which is usually used in office communication, only connects one participant with one other at one time. For the connection between several participants, additional hardware, i.e. a switch, is necessary. This effort is not **necessary using CAN. How the network has to be organised is described in the following** chapter 4.2.3 *Topology*. <chunk_seperator> By setting the object to 0, any error memory that may exist is deleted. Values which are different from 0 may not be written into the object. 

Standard error field 1 … 1003h 1 …

When sending an *EMCY***, the device will add the related error to the error list.** 
The content of each entry is composed of the ""*emergency error code***"" (EMCY-EC) (16 bit)** and the lower 16 bit of the ""*Manufacturer status register***"" (MSR-LW).**

Question:  What is the purpose of the Pre-Defined Error Field 1003H, and how does it store error messages?","The Pre-Defined Error Field 1003H is an object that stores error messages in the device. It is a combined data type in the form of a list (ARRAY) that contains individual entries, each describing an error that has occurred in the device. The error list is not stored in the persistent memory of the device, which means it will be erased after a device restart.

The object contains the following information:

* Number of errors (1003h 0 UNSIGNED8 rw): This is the current number of error messages saved in the error memory. If no error has been detected, the content is 0. The maximum size of the list depends on the device configuration, but for most products, the list is set to have a maximum of 10 entries.
* Standard error field 1 … 1003h 1 … (1003.0 UNSIGNED32 ro): Each entry in the error list is composed of the ""emergency error code"" (EMCY-EC) (16 bits) and the lower 16 bits of the ""Manufacturer status register"" (MSR-LW).

When an EMCY message is sent, the device will add the related error to the error list. By setting the object to 0, any error memory that may exist is deleted. Values that are different from 0 may not be written into the object.

In summary, the Pre-Defined Error Field 1003H is used to store error messages in the device, with each entry containing information about the error, including the emergency error code and manufacturer status register. The error list is not persistent and will be erased after a device restart."

Question:  What is the purpose of the object for device address management, as described in chapter 4.4 Network Management?","The provided context describes the object for device address management and baud rate management in the context of CANopen default settings. 

The device address management involves two objects: the active node-ID (2001h 1) and the pending node-ID (2001h 2). The active node-ID represents the currently active device address, which can be read only. The pending node-ID, on the other hand, represents the desired change of the device address, which can be read and written. The values of these two objects are identical under normal operation. However, if there is a request for a new device address when the changes have not yet become active, the two objects will be assigned different values. 

The baud rate management also involves two objects: the active baud rate (2002h 1) and the pending baud rate (2002h 2). The active baud rate represents the currently active baud rate, which can be read only. The pending baud rate, on the other hand, represents the desired change of the baud rate, which can be read and written. The values of these two objects are identical under normal operation. However, if there is a request for a new baud rate when the changes have not yet become active, the two objects will be assigned different values. 

Additionally, some devices offer additional manufacturer-specific measurement channels that complete the standard measurement variables. These channels can provide ""real"" measurement signals with a defined specification in the data sheet, such as accuracy or temperature, but also internal signals, such as the device temperature. The process values of these additional manufacturer-specific measurement channels can be transferred via a TPDO. However, not all devices support these channels, which means that the objects listed may be only partly available or not at all."

## 17.2 Maintenance/Calibrage

Les appareils de mesure portables de la série HMG 4000 ne nécessitent aucun entretien et fonctionnent parfaitement dans les conditions d'utilisation spécifiées (voir les caractéristiques techniques). Nous recommandons toutefois de faire procéder régulièrement à un calibrage de l'appareil. 

Selon l'utilisation et le domaine d'application, un calibrage cyclique de l'HMG 4000 est impératif, voire prescrit (par ex., sur les bancs d'essai).

If the application software's error callback is executed due to a failing safety switch startup test (i.e. error code *DIAG_E_SSW_TEST*), the application software **shall** define an action to be taken according to the overall system design.

Category: Comment ID: 808085 In case of a failing safety switch startup test that cannot be traced back to an isolated failure of an associated PWM high side stage, the complete safety switch group might be impaired. The system integrator is therefore advised to immediately disable the affected safety switch and all connected PWM high side stages.

A defective safety switch—acting as secondary shut-off path of a safety-related PWM high side stage—is considered dangerous and does therefore not allow further operation of the affected PWM high side stages.

## 4.6. Application Data <chunk_seperator> ## 6.5.3.8 Active Motor Brake

With bidirectional motor drive active braking by shorting the motor terminals is supported.

## 6.5.3.9 Motors Reversing With / Without Braking

Motor reversing out of full speed can lead to unexpected high **motor current. The cause is that for** example a 24 V motor running at nominal speed has a back EMF of almost 24 V with the same sign as the voltage applied. By sudden revering the EMF-voltage adds to the terminal voltage, which means the motor current is as high as with starting at 48 V battery voltage. In other words, the peak motor current is doubled by sudden reverse. For small motors this is neither a problem to the motor nor to the driving power stages. For bigger motors a braking phase needs to be inserted first followed by the reversing command.

Question:  What is the purpose of the MS autozero 3616 1 **UNSIGNED32 WO** command in the context of manufacturer-specific measurement channels?","

The purpose of the MS autozero 3616 1 **UNSIGNED32 WO** command is to activate the default zero-offset (value offset) of the first additional manufacturer-specific measurement channel. 

In the context of manufacturer-specific measurement channels, this command is used to set the default zero-offset value for the first additional channel. This value offset is used to adjust the measurement values obtained from the device to a standardized reference point. By setting the default zero-offset, the device can provide more accurate and reliable measurement data.

The **UNSIGNED32 WO** part of the command specifies the data type and access type of the value offset. **UNSIGNED32** indicates that the value offset is an unsigned 32-bit integer, and **WO** specifies that the access type is write-only, meaning that the value offset can only be written to the device and not read from it.

In summary, the MS autozero 3616 1 **UNSIGNED32 WO** command is used to set the default zero-offset value for the first additional manufacturer-specific measurement channel, allowing the device to provide more accurate and reliable measurement data."

## 6.5.3.9 Motors Reversing With / Without Braking

Motor reversing out of full speed can lead to unexpected high **motor current. The cause is that for** example a 24 V motor running at nominal speed has a back EMF of almost 24 V with the same sign as the voltage applied. By sudden revering the EMF-voltage adds to the terminal voltage, which means the motor current is as high as with starting at 48 V battery voltage. In other words, the peak motor current is doubled by sudden reverse. For small motors this is neither a problem to the motor nor to the driving power stages. For bigger motors a braking phase needs to be inserted first followed by the reversing command.

Question:  What information is provided in the description of an EDS file, and what are some examples of important EDS entries?","In the description of an EDS (Electronic Data Sheet) file, general information is provided about the file itself and the device it describes. The EDS file is a machine-readable description of the OD (Object Dictionary), which lists all objects supported by the device. Each object has a multi-line entry for its own description, including its object index, object name, object type, data type, access type, and other properties.

Some examples of important EDS entries include:

1. **Object Index**: A unique identifier for each object, such as 1000, 1001, 1003, etc.

2. **Object Name**: A descriptive name for each object, such as ""Pre"", ""Error register"", ""Identity object"", etc.

3. **Object Type**: Defines the type of object, such as VAR, ARRAY, RECORD, etc.

4. **Data Type**: Specifies how the object is stored in memory, such as UNSIGNED8, UNSIGNED16, UNSIGNED32, REAL32, STRING, etc.

5. **Access Type**: Defines the access rights for the object, such as ro (read-only), rw (read-write), rwr (read-write with reset), wo (write-only), const (constant), etc.

6. **PDOMapping**: Specifies the mapping of the object to a specific PDO (Process Data Object).

7. **DefaultValue**: Provides the pre-configuration value of the object.

8. **BaudRate_xxx**: Specifies the baud rate for serial communication.

9. **NrOfRXPDO** and **NrOfTXPDO**: Define the number of receive and transmit PDOs (Process Data Objects) supported by the device.

10. **LSS_Supported**: Indicates whether the device supports Layer Setting Services (LSS).

These EDS entries provide essential information about the device's objects, their properties, and how they can be accessed and used in applications."

## 4.6. Application Data <chunk_seperator> ## 6.5.3.8 Active Motor Brake

With bidirectional motor drive active braking by shorting the motor terminals is supported.

## 6.5.3.9 Motors Reversing With / Without Braking

Motor reversing out of full speed can lead to unexpected high **motor current. The cause is that for** example a 24 V motor running at nominal speed has a back EMF of almost 24 V with the same sign as the voltage applied. By sudden revering the EMF-voltage adds to the terminal voltage, which means the motor current is as high as with starting at 48 V battery voltage. In other words, the peak motor current is doubled by sudden reverse. For small motors this is neither a problem to the motor nor to the driving power stages. For bigger motors a braking phase needs to be inserted first followed by the reversing command.

## 4.6.1.1. Structure Of The Sdo Command

Below, please find a description of the general structure of all SDO messages. The commands depends on the used access type.

See chapter *4.4.1 Overview network* **conditions.** 
The data type of the object (see chapter *4.5.7 EDS Electronic Data Sheet* and *DataType*) 
controls the process of the SDO communication. All objects whose data type is 32 bit and shorter can be read or written to directly by means of a single SDO command ""expedited"" ,

Category: Comment ID: 592219 The HY-TTC 500 platform provides the following types of analog inputs that can be used for safetycritical applications:
- 3 mode analog inputs (for voltage and current measurement), configurable by software
- 2 mode analog inputs (for voltage and current measurement), configurable by software Note: The HY-TTC 500 platform does not provide diagnostic measures for the 3 mode analog inputs' resistive measurement setting. If a specific diagnostic coverage is required for usage within safety-critical applications, the system integrator has to provide means to detect failures within these input stages.

Category: Requirement Label: Analog_Guideline ID: 592225 Related To: Related To':
The sensors used for safety-critical analog inputs **shall** be chosen in accordance with section *Sensor* Selection Guideline. <chunk_seperator> ## Periodically

The term '*periodically*' or '*periodical*' within this documents refers for example to a frequently call of a function or a regular check of a state or variable. However, the 'periodically' condition is not related to certain time base, but to software cycles. Whenever something has to be done periodically, the said event shall be triggered at least *once per software cycle*.

## Safe State

In the *safe state* zero current is applied to the safety-critical outputs of the ECU, i.e. in case of an error all outputs will be switched off.

Safety-critical / Safety-relevant System The term *safety-critical* in the context of this document refers to a system whose failure or malfunction may result in death or injury. The HY-TTC 500 has been designed to fulfill ISO 13849 Category 2, Performance Level d and IEC 61508, Safety Integrity Level 2 requirements.

## Safety Function <chunk_seperator> ## 4.6. Application Data

CANopen provides different types of data communication. Each of these communication types will not be available at each operation condition; see chapter *4.4.1 Overview network* conditions. 

## 4.6.1. Sdo

SDO, abbr. for ""Service data o**bject"" offers the opportunity for direct access to the individual** 
objects in the OD; see chapter *4.5 The Object* **Dictionary.** 
It is possible to have read only and read/write access to the object. During access, the object address serves as an indicator, which object the access should be given to; see chapter 4.5.1.1 Addressing. <chunk_seperator> If the server detects an error while processing a request command, it will report it to the client sending an ""SDO abort transfer"" response. The data field of the SDO command serves to transmit a cancel code (error number).

This example shows the attempt to write a value into the object 7654 ""**manufacturer-specific**

## Remarque
Question:  What is the PDO mapping process, and how do different areas of the OD work together in this process?","The PDO (Process Data Object) mapping process is a complex procedure in which various areas of the OD (Object Dictionary) work together to map process data onto a TPDO (Transport Protocol Data Object). This process involves defining when a PDO is supposed to be transmitted and which objects from the OD will copy.

In the provided example, the measurement signal ""statical inclination"" from an inclinometer by HYDAC Filtertechnik GmbH is transmitted via the TPDO1. The area ""PDO communication parameter"" defines when a PDO is supposed to be transmitted, and the area ""PDO mapping parameter"" defines which objects from the OD will copy.

The image [117_image_0.png] illustrates the PDO mapping process, where the letter ""I"" is prominently displayed within a black and white square, indicating the main focus of the scene.

The table [table_92] shows the PDO message structure, which includes the CAN-ID, byte 0 to byte 7, index, name, access, data type, and other parameters.

The PDO mapping process involves several areas of the OD working together, including the PDO communication parameter, PDO mapping parameter, and the OD objects. The process flow sequence to change the PDO mapping involves setting the PDO as invalid, deactivating the number of object references used in the PDO, setting new object references in the ""PDO mapping parameter"" area, and saving changes permanently on the device.

In the provided example, the PDO mapping process is demonstrated through a series of steps, including declaring the PDO as invalid, deactivating the number of object references used in the PDO, setting new object references in the ""PDO mapping parameter"" area, and saving changes permanently on the device.

The PDO mapping process is a critical procedure that requires strict adherence to defined protocols to ensure accurate and reliable data transmission.

## Remarque
Question:  What defines when a PDO is supposed to be transmitted, and which objects from the OD will copy or read that particular PDO message?","The answer is that the PDO mapping defines when a PDO is supposed to be transmitted, and which objects from the OD will copy or read that particular PDO message.

In the PDO mapping process, the device's PDO is configured to transmit specific data at specific times. This is achieved by defining the PDO mapping, which specifies the objects from the OD that will be copied or read when the PDO is transmitted. The PDO mapping is used to control the transmission of PDO messages, and it defines which objects from the OD will be accessed during the transmission.

For example, in the provided image, the PDO mapping is defined as follows:

PDO mapping: 181h
Transmission type: UNSIGNED8
PDO ID: 180h
Objects to be copied or read: 6010.0, 6020.0, 5000.0

This means that when the PDO is transmitted, the objects 6010.0, 6020.0, and 5000.0 will be accessed and their values will be transmitted as part of the PDO message."

## Remarque
Question:  What are the steps involved in changing the PDO mapping of a device, and how can this be done without causing errors?","To change the PDO mapping of a device, a strict procedure must be followed to avoid errors. The steps involved in this process are as follows:

1. **Switch the device to ""Pre-Operational"" mode**: This is a necessary step to ensure that the device is in a state where the PDO mapping can be changed.

2. **Declare the PDO as invalid**: To do this, bit 31 of the COB-ID has to be set to 1. For example, TPDO.COB ID Bit 31 = set 1, e.g., 1800.1 = C00000180h, and RPDO.COB ID Bit 31 = set 1, e.g., 1400.1 = 800000200h180h.

3. **Deactivate the number of object references used in the PDO**: The number of object references has to be set to 0. This can be done by accessing the object ""Number of mapped objects in PDO"" in the RPDO.

4. **Set new object references in the ""PDO mapping parameter"" area**: The new object references have to be set in this area. The number of new entries should be memorized for the next step.

5. **Set the number of object references used in the PDO to a new value**: The number of object references has to be set to the new value memorized in the previous step.

6. **Set PDO back to valid**: To do this, bit 31 of the COB-ID has to be set to 0 or the object = 0 has to be set to activate the standard behavior. For example, TPDO.COB ID and RPDO.COB ID.

7. **Save changes permanently on the device**: The changes have to be saved permanently on the device by accessing the object ""Save communication parameters"".

8. **Switch the device to ""Operational"" mode**: Finally, the device has to be switched back to ""Operational"" mode.

By following these steps, the PDO mapping of a device can be changed without causing errors."

## Remarque
Question:  What is the significance of the ""Operational"" mode, and how is it different from the ""Pre-Operational"" mode in the context of PDO mapping?","In the context of PDO mapping, the ""Operational"" mode and the ""Pre-Operational"" mode are two distinct states of a device that affect how the PDO mapping is handled.

The ""Pre-Operational"" mode is a temporary state that allows the device to be configured or reconfigured without affecting its normal operation. In this mode, the PDO mapping can be changed, and the device will not respond to access requests, thereby preventing any errors or inconsistencies. This mode is necessary when modifying the PDO mapping, as it ensures that the device does not attempt to transmit or receive data using the old PDO mapping.

On the other hand, the ""Operational"" mode is the normal operating state of the device, where it is actively transmitting and receiving data using the configured PDO mapping. In this mode, the device responds to access requests and operates as expected.

The key differences between the two modes are:

1. **PDO mapping changes**: In ""Pre-Operational"" mode, the PDO mapping can be modified, whereas in ""Operational"" mode, the PDO mapping is fixed and in use.
2. **Device response**: In ""Pre-Operational"" mode, the device does not respond to access requests, whereas in ""Operational"" mode, the device responds to access requests and operates normally.
3. **Data transmission**: In ""Pre-Operational"" mode, data transmission is inhibited, whereas in ""Operational"" mode, data transmission occurs according to the configured PDO mapping.

To change the PDO mapping, the device must be switched to ""Pre-Operational"" mode, the changes made, and then switched back to ""Operational"" mode to activate the new PDO mapping. This ensures a safe and controlled transition between different PDO mapping configurations."

Avant le raccordement d'un participant ou la connexion sur un système de bus CAN externe, les préréglages suivants doivent avoir été effectués sur l'HMG 4000 : 

## - **Vitesse De Transmission**

Pour la configuration de participants ou la journalisation des messages, l'HMG 4000 doit être réglé sur la vitesse de transmission du participant ou du système de bus externe. Les vitesses de transmission possibles vont de 10 kbit/s à 1 Mbit/s.

Question:  What is the role of the first phase in the switchover procedure, and what happens after it expires?","The role of the first phase in the switchover procedure is to serve as a de-initialization phase for all participants. Within this time range, all participants should terminate the sending of their messages, which is referred to as the ""device reaction time"". This phase allows all network participants to stop sending messages and prepare for the switch to the new Baud rate.

After the first phase expires, the second phase begins, which serves as a reinitialization phase. After the second phase has expired, messages may be sent with the new Baud rate. This means that all participants have completed the de-initialization process and are ready to start sending messages using the newly configured Baud rate."

Question:  What is the function of the ""store configuration"" command, and how does it relate to the ""Node ID"" and ""Baud rate""?","The function of the ""store configuration"" command is to permanently store changes to the Node ID and the Baud rate on the device. This command enables the device to save the new Node ID and Baud rate configuration, making it a permanent change. 

The ""store configuration"" command relates to the ""Node ID"" and ""Baud rate"" by storing the new values of these parameters on the device. This means that the device will use the new Node ID and Baud rate for future communications, ensuring that the changes made to these parameters are retained even after a power cycle or reset. 

In the context of the provided tables, the ""store configuration"" command is used to save the new Baud rate and Node ID configurations on the device. This command is implemented according to the Request response model, which is shown in tables [table_99.png] and [table_100.png].

Question:  What is the purpose of the ""LSS Fastscan"" command, and how does it relate to the LSS configuration mode?","The purpose of the ""LSS Fastscan"" command is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that the ""LSS Fastscan"" command is related to the LSS configuration mode.

In the LSS configuration mode, a device is switched to this mode using a defined LSS address, which is sent to the device in four consecutive command requests. After the command sequence has expired, the device responds with the ""Identify slave"" command.

The ""LSS Fastscan"" command might be used to quickly scan or detect devices in the network that support the LSS protocol, possibly to initiate the configuration process or to identify devices that are already configured.

Without further information, the exact purpose and behavior of the ""LSS Fastscan"" command cannot be determined."

This part of the screen has a focus on the left side. <chunk_seperator> With the fastscan protocol, a LSS master can identify the *LSS address* **of unknown and nonconfigured devices.

The PDO mapping is a complex process in which several areas of the OD work together.

Due to internal limitations, the size of the SPI communication buffer is limited to 64 B. This is also the effective page size for the EEPROM/FRAM.

The communication buffer size has impact on the performance **of the read/write operations** but it does not limit the size of the data that can be read of written by the API functions. The API functions will process the read/write requests over multiple pages if necessary.

## 7.10.2.1 Read And Write Speeds Of The Background Processing

The maximum duration of reading **an EEPROM/FRAM page, when relying on the background interrupt, is 3 ms. The full page buffer is used when the data start address and size is aligned to 64**

Question:  What is the COB ID, and how is it related to the CAN ID of the PDO message?","The COB ID refers to the CAN ID of the PDO message as a hexadecimal value. This value has to correspond with the CAN ID of the PDO, which is going to be interpreted. As each measurement channel of the HMG 4000 is independent, the CAN ID has to be predetermined the same way as the message will be transmitted. An automatic calculation via the Node ID is not possible.

In other words, the COB ID is a unique identifier assigned to a PDO message, which is used to identify the message on the CAN bus. It is a hexadecimal value that must match the CAN ID of the PDO message being transmitted. This ensures that the correct message is interpreted by the receiving device.

For example, as shown in the table, the COB ID could be 1800h, which corresponds to the Node ID 5 and the measured value COB-ID 185h. This means that the PDO message with CAN ID 1800h will be interpreted as the measured value from Node ID 5.

It is essential to note that the COB ID is related to the CAN ID of the PDO message, and both values must match for proper communication and interpretation of the message."

## Power Values

Selects power configuration. <chunk_seperator> In addition to the main content displayed within these windows, there are several other elements present in the image. A clock can be seen on the left side of the screen, and a cell phone is located near the top right corner. The presence of these objects suggests that this scene might be taking place in an office or workspace environment.)

While using this function, several devices may be connected at the same time. This is why it is inevitable to preselect the *Node ID* **(node ID) of the device you wish to use before importing any data.** 
The suitable file for the device used can now be selected from a list of EDS files available on the HMG 4000. The files often contain the manufacturer's part number as an identifier in the file name. In a first step, available files have to be copied into the ""file manager"" in the HMG 4000 directory ""CanTools\Eds\General"". After ""open"", all the objects will be loaded from the OD and visualised as a list. <chunk_seperator> Object entries can now be changed as well as viewed. In order to store them on the device permanently, the function ""memory"" must be used. This function performs the Object function ""*Save all parameters"".*
Note**: If the node ID or the Baud rate are changed directly in the EDS window, the function** 
""*Save LSS parameters*"" also has to be changed via the EDS window, as described in chapter *4.5.4.3 Storage and restoring (general communication objects).*
 The PDO wizard is a special feature. With this function, the *PDO Mapping* **can be** 
configured very easily. The PDO wizard leads you through all the objects of the 
""*communication*"" and ""*mapping parameter*"" step by step. 

 The SRDO wizard is another special feature. This special wizard helps you carry out the more complicated configurations of safety-relevant process values. Whether such values are supported by this device used is described in chapter *3.4 Functionally safe process* data. <chunk_seperator> ![154_image_0.png]( The image displays two side-by-side screens with German text on them. Each screen has a different configuration of information displayed. On one screen, there is a table with various columns and rows of data, while the other screen features a list of items in a foreign language.

to the CAN chronologically or grouped according to *CAN ID***. The received messages can**

Details about the errors of the diagnostic state machine. The following table gives an overview of the error codes and their types.

There are **four types of errors**:
- **Persistent fatal errors**
If a fatal error is detected, the diagnostic state machine always activates the safe state. The application will be informed about the error before a reset occurs (via the notification callback, see **DIAG_NOTIFY_CB).**
- **Persistent non-fatal errors**
For non-fatal errors the application can decide which action to take (via the error callback, see DIAG_ERROR_CB).

- **Temporary fatal errors**
For these errors a glitch filter (de-bounce) is implemented, **which means that they are reported** after the configured anti-glitch time. After the glitch filter time has expired, the error will be treated like a persistent fatal error.

## - **Temporary Non-Fatal Errors** <chunk_seperator> The first ""RPDO mapping parameter"" has the index 1600, the second one

Question:  **Messages**: The system allows users to list and view CAN messages, which can be grouped by CAN ID. Users can also define their own messages, which can be sent spontaneously or periodically to other CAN participants.","The ""messages"" function provides users with the ability to list and view CAN messages, which can be organized chronologically or grouped according to their corresponding CAN ID. This feature enables users to interpret and represent the received messages via the HMG 4000, prioritizing them by order of importance as described in chapter 4.3.2, ""Meaning of the CAN ID."" The system also allows users to define their own messages, which can be sent spontaneously or periodically to other CAN participants. These user-defined messages can be used to simulate various tasks or functions, such as sending important notifications or updates to other nodes in the network.

In addition to listing and viewing CAN messages, the system provides users with the ability to send their own messages, which can be customized to meet specific needs or requirements. For instance, a user can define a message to send a ""SDO expedited Download"" command from the object ""StoreLSSParameter,"" which enables changes to the node ID or Baud rate of a device to be stored permanently. This message writes the character string ""save"" having 4 bytes into the object 1010.4, triggering the object function.

The system's functionality is further enhanced by the ability to send messages periodically, allowing users to simulate tasks such as an SYNC Master. To achieve this, a cycle time of greater than 0 ms must be assigned to the message. Overall, the ""messages"" function provides users with a powerful tool for managing and communicating with other CAN participants, enabling them to customize their experience and achieve specific goals or objectives."

Details about the errors of the diagnostic state machine. The following table gives an overview of the error codes and their types.

There are **four types of errors**:
- **Persistent fatal errors**
If a fatal error is detected, the diagnostic state machine always activates the safe state. The application will be informed about the error before a reset occurs (via the notification callback, see **DIAG_NOTIFY_CB).**
- **Persistent non-fatal errors**
For non-fatal errors the application can decide which action to take (via the error callback, see DIAG_ERROR_CB).

- **Temporary fatal errors**
For these errors a glitch filter (de-bounce) is implemented, **which means that they are reported** after the configured anti-glitch time. After the glitch filter time has expired, the error will be treated like a persistent fatal error.

## - **Temporary Non-Fatal Errors** <chunk_seperator> The first ""RPDO mapping parameter"" has the index 1600, the second one

Question:  **Send**: Users can send CAN messages, which can be generated spontaneously or periodically. Examples of CAN messages include ""SDO expedite Download"" commands, which enable changes to the node ID or baud rate of a device to be stored permanently.","The ""messages"" function in the HMG 4000 provides users with the ability to list and interpret CAN messages, which can be connected to the CAN chronologically or grouped according to CAN ID. This function also allows users to define their own messages, which can be sent spontaneously or periodically to further CAN participants. 

In the context of network management, the HMG 4000 can simulate the tasks of a CANopen Master by providing the most important NMT messages. The NMT status of the connected network participants can be changed using the sub-functions of the Network Management function.

The ASCII character set is a 7-bit character encoding standard that assigns a unique numerical value to each character, including letters, digits, punctuation marks, and control characters.

The significance of the ASCII character set lies in its ability to provide a common language for computers to communicate and represent characters. It enables devices and systems to understand and process characters in a standardized way, facilitating seamless communication and data exchange.

The ASCII character set is important for several reasons:

1. **Universal compatibility**: ASCII is widely supported by most devices, operating systems, and programming languages, ensuring that characters are represented consistently across different platforms.
2. **Standardized character representation**: ASCII provides a standardized way of representing characters, making it easier to develop software and systems that can handle characters from different languages and scripts.
3. **Efficient data storage and transmission**: ASCII's 7-bit encoding allows for efficient storage and transmission of character data, reducing the amount of memory and bandwidth required.
4. **Easy character manipulation**: ASCII's numerical representation of characters enables easy manipulation of characters using arithmetic operations, making it simpler to perform tasks like character recognition, sorting, and searching.
5. **Foundation for other character sets**: ASCII serves as a foundation for other character sets, such as Unicode, which builds upon the ASCII character set to provide support for a broader range of languages and scripts.

In the context of the provided examples, the ASCII character set is used to represent characters in a hexadecimal format, demonstrating how characters can be encoded and decoded using ASCII values. The examples also highlight the importance of ASCII in providing a standardized way of representing characters, which is essential for effective communication and data exchange between devices and systems."

Question:  How can the numeric value of a particular character be determined using the horizontal and vertical identification code?","According to the ASCII table provided, the numeric value of a particular character can be determined by summing the horizontal and vertical identification codes. 

For example, if the vertical identification code is 30 and the horizontal identification code is 2, the numeric value of the character would be 32d (20h), which represents a blank space. 

Similarly, if the vertical identification code is 60 and the horizontal identification code is 5, the numeric value of the character would be 65d (41h), which represents the capital letter A. 

This method allows for the determination of the numeric value of any character in the ASCII character set using its horizontal and vertical identification codes."
