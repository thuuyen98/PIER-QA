The system integrator **shall** consider the HY-TTC 500 platform's effective failure reaction time for each safety function.

Category: Comment ID: 813084 For calculating the worst case failure reaction time, the system integrator has to combine the core diagnostic's failure reaction time (being independent from the used I/Os) and the additional I/O related failure reaction time (taking into account the I/O specific diagnostic time delay). That way, the overall failure reaction time can be determined accurately, for each individual safety function.

Category: Comment ID: 592219 The HY-TTC 500 platform provides the following types of analog inputs that can be used for safetycritical applications:
- 3 mode analog inputs (for voltage and current measurement), configurable by software
- 2 mode analog inputs (for voltage and current measurement), configurable by software Note: The HY-TTC 500 platform does not provide diagnostic measures for the 3 mode analog inputs' resistive measurement setting. If a specific diagnostic coverage is required for usage within safety-critical applications, the system integrator has to provide means to detect failures within these input stages.

## 1.6. Changes In Technical Terms In The Context Of ""Political Correctness"" <chunk_seperator> The following sections will explain general, non-product specific information for a better understanding of the functioning principle of a measurement system with a communication interface. 

## 2.1. General Communication Characteristics

In general, the measurement systems are the end-nodes within a communication network. They do not take control of their superordinate network themselves. However, these devices are able to generate and send information spontaneously. This means that the measurement systems mainly serve as a data source - they generate process data. 

The following types of information can be generated and processed by the measurement system: 
 *Process data* **current actual or nominal values**
 *Parameters* **System data for the device identification or configuration**
 *Events* **Information on particular events, such as errors** 
The information types listed here are explained in more detail in the following chapters.

 A2h **A2 hexadecimal → 162 decimal** 

 16d **16 decimal → 10 hexadecimal** 66 **66 decimal → 42 hexadecimal** 

 10b **10 binary → 2 decimal** 

In other documentations, i.e. EDS files, you will also frequently encounter the format 
""0**x1042"". Here, the prefix ""0x"" marks the subsequent number as a hexadecimal.** When describing the entries in the OD (see chapter *4.5 The Object* Dictionary). **The index** 
is always shown in hexadecimal notation, but without any particular markings. 

## 2.3. Bit Order

The measurement systems use the ""Little Endian"" format for the transmission of their numeric values. In this representation of numeric values, the lowest bit (LSB; ""least significant bit"") will be stored and added the lowest data block address. 

## 2.3.1. Counting Principle For Bit And Byte Position In The Data Block <chunk_seperator> ## 1.6. Changes In Technical Terms In The Context Of ""Political Correctness""

HYDAC Filtertechnik GmbH continuously strives to respect human rights and every individual's dignity in any context. However, when it comes to communication technology, one technical term is still very common: ""Master - Slave"". In order to avoid this archaic and discriminating expression, the term has been replaced wherever possible in this documentation, using the following substitution: ""Master - Device"" (""Device"" replacing ""Slave""). The only exceptions are terms which are used in this form in official documentation. These exceptions are only used to make it easier for the reader to understand the connection between this documentation and the official documents. 

## 2. Fundamentals And Basics

The following sections will explain general, non-product specific information for a better understanding of the functioning principle of a measurement system with a communication interface. <chunk_seperator> ## 7.15.2 Macro Definition Documentation 7.15.2.1 #Define Io_Adc_00 Io_Pin_103 <chunk_seperator> ## 3.1.2 Definition Of The Safe State

Category: Comment ID: 586823 In the safe state, no current will be applied to the safety-critical outputs of the ECU, i.e. in case of an error the safety-critical outputs will be switched off. One has to keep in mind, however, that the outputs are equipped with pull-up resistors to 5 V for diagnostic reasons. As this pull-up characteristic will not be disabled in the safe state, a minimal diagnostic current may flow through connected loads even in the safe state. The typical diagnostic currents are specified in the corresponding output's section within the HY-TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM], Part I: Hardware Description.

Category: Comment ID: 1194971 For diagnostic reasons, the ECU's sensor supply outputs are not automatically switched off when entering the safe state. It is therefore not recommended to use the sensor supply outputs as a power source that should be disabled immediately, in case of a safe state transition.
Question:  What is the purpose of Chapter 2 in the document?","Chapter 2, titled ""Fundamentals And Basics,"" serves to provide foundational, non-product specific information that aids in understanding the principles behind the functioning of a measurement system equipped with a communication interface. This chapter is essential for grasping the general concepts and characteristics that apply to such systems, regardless of specific product details. 

Key sections within this chapter include:

1. **General Communication Characteristics**: This section explains that measurement systems act as end-nodes within a communication network, primarily serving as data sources that generate and send information spontaneously. It categorizes the types of information these systems handle, such as process data, parameters, and events.

2. **Display Of Numeric Figures**: This part clarifies how numeric figures are represented in the document, including decimal, hexadecimal, and binary formats. It provides examples and explains the suffixes used to denote different number bases.

3. **Bit Order**: This section describes the ""Little Endian"" format used by the measurement systems for transmitting numeric values, where the least significant bit (LSB) is stored at the lowest data block address.

4. **Counting Principle For Bit And Byte Position In The Data Block**: This subsection outlines the method used in the document for counting bit positions within a continuous data block, starting from 0.

Overall, Chapter 2 lays the groundwork for understanding the technical details and communication protocols discussed in subsequent chapters, ensuring that readers have a solid grasp of the basic principles before delving into more specific and complex information."

The general structure is divided into the following essential chapters. 

## 2 Fundamentals **And Basics**

General information explaining the function principle of a measuring system equipped with a communication interface. 

## 3 Product **Interface**

All the product specific characteristics are described here. Certain sections of this description may repeat and differ at the same time in the protocol description if the measurement system described herein deviates from the general protocol description or if the properties of the protocol description are complemented.

## 4 Protocol Description **Canopen**

The general protocol description provides you with all information required for a successful communication. It explains, for instance, how the process data is transmitted with this specific communication protocol. In addition, it explains how to change the measurement system configuration settings. <chunk_seperator> 7.24.3 Function Documentation 7.24.3.1 void _c_int00 ( void )

The nodes are organized into several groups, each representing different aspects of the system. These groups include ""Leads,"" ""Opportunities,"" ""Activities,"" ""Tasks,"" and ""Resources.""

The arrows connecting these nodes indicate relationships between them, such as dependencies or interactions. For example, there is a strong connection between the ""Leads"" group and the ""Activities"" group, suggesting that leads are often associated with specific activities within the system. The diagram provides a visual representation of the complex structure of this particular network, making it easier to understand its components and their relationships.)

## Macros <chunk_seperator> ## 4.2.2.1 General

Category: Comment ID: 592219 The HY-TTC 500 platform provides the following types of analog inputs that can be used for safetycritical applications:
- 3 mode analog inputs (for voltage and current measurement), configurable by software
- 2 mode analog inputs (for voltage and current measurement), configurable by software Note: The HY-TTC 500 platform does not provide diagnostic measures for the 3 mode analog inputs' resistive measurement setting. If a specific diagnostic coverage is required for usage within safety-critical applications, the system integrator has to provide means to detect failures within these input stages.

Category: Requirement Label: Analog_Guideline ID: 592225 Related To: Related To':
The sensors used for safety-critical analog inputs **shall** be chosen in accordance with section *Sensor* Selection Guideline. <chunk_seperator> ## 2.3.1. Counting Principle For Bit And Byte Position In The Data Block

In practice, there are different ways of counting in order to define the positon of a particular date within a data block. For this documentation, the following way of counting has been defined: 
 Bit **positions within a continuous data block start with** 0. <chunk_seperator> ## 1.5.2. Notes On Using This Documentation Efficiently

In order to get quick access to particular subjects, this document is linked with active crossreferences (hyperlinks). These are formatted in *italics*. 

This chapter *3.1 Quick* **guide is designed to lead you to responses to the most frequently** 
asked questions as quickly as possible. 

Symbols and abbreviations are explained in chapters 1.3 *Symbols* and 1.4 **Abbreviations** 
used and definitions.

The display of numeric figures is explained in chapter 2.2 *Display* **of numeric figures.** 
Technical English terms are placed between quotation marks (""..""). 

## 1.6. Changes In Technical Terms In The Context Of ""Political Correctness"" <chunk_seperator> The following sections will explain general, non-product specific information for a better understanding of the functioning principle of a measurement system with a communication interface. 

## 2.1. General Communication Characteristics

In general, the measurement systems are the end-nodes within a communication network. They do not take control of their superordinate network themselves. However, these devices are able to generate and send information spontaneously. This means that the measurement systems mainly serve as a data source - they generate process data. 

The following types of information can be generated and processed by the measurement system: 
 *Process data* **current actual or nominal values**
 *Parameters* **System data for the device identification or configuration**
 *Events* **Information on particular events, such as errors** 
The information types listed here are explained in more detail in the following chapters. 

## 2.2. Display Of Numeric Figures <chunk_seperator> ## Note

 A2h **A2 hexadecimal → 162 decimal** 

 16d **16 decimal → 10 hexadecimal** 66 **66 decimal → 42 hexadecimal** 

 10b **10 binary → 2 decimal** 

In other documentations, i.e. EDS files, you will also frequently encounter the format 
""0**x1042"". Here, the prefix ""0x"" marks the subsequent number as a hexadecimal.** When describing the entries in the OD (see chapter *4.5 The Object* Dictionary). **The index** 
is always shown in hexadecimal notation, but without any particular markings. 

## 2.3. Bit Order

The measurement systems use the ""Little Endian"" format for the transmission of their numeric values. In this representation of numeric values, the lowest bit (LSB; ""least significant bit"") will be stored and added the lowest data block address. 

## 2.3.1. Counting Principle For Bit And Byte Position In The Data Block <chunk_seperator> ## 1.6. Changes In Technical Terms In The Context Of ""Political Correctness""

HYDAC Filtertechnik GmbH continuously strives to respect human rights and every individual's dignity in any context. However, when it comes to communication technology, one technical term is still very common: ""Master - Slave"". In order to avoid this archaic and discriminating expression, the term has been replaced wherever possible in this documentation, using the following substitution: ""Master - Device"" (""Device"" replacing ""Slave""). The only exceptions are terms which are used in this form in official documentation. These exceptions are only used to make it easier for the reader to understand the connection between this documentation and the official documents. 

## 2. Fundamentals And Basics

The following sections will explain general, non-product specific information for a better understanding of the functioning principle of a measurement system with a communication interface. <chunk_seperator> ## 7.15.2 Macro Definition Documentation 7.15.2.1 #Define Io_Adc_00 Io_Pin_103 <chunk_seperator> ## 3.1.2 Definition Of The Safe State

Category: Comment ID: 586823 In the safe state, no current will be applied to the safety-critical outputs of the ECU, i.e. in case of an error the safety-critical outputs will be switched off. One has to keep in mind, however, that the outputs are equipped with pull-up resistors to 5 V for diagnostic reasons. As this pull-up characteristic will not be disabled in the safe state, a minimal diagnostic current may flow through connected loads even in the safe state. The typical diagnostic currents are specified in the corresponding output's section within the HY-TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM], Part I: Hardware Description.

Category: Comment ID: 1194971 For diagnostic reasons, the ECU's sensor supply outputs are not automatically switched off when entering the safe state. It is therefore not recommended to use the sensor supply outputs as a power source that should be disabled immediately, in case of a safe state transition.

## 2.4.3. Boolean

The data type BOOLEAN is used to illustrate binary signals. These are signals which are not able to adopt more than two logical states. The data length in the memory may vary.

## 2.3.3. Display Of A 32 Bit Integer Number Within The Data Block

In the following example, the transmission of an *INTEGER***32, e.g. of a 32 bit signed integer** 
numeric value, within a data block of a CAN message (8 bytes) is shown in the ""Little Endian"" format.

The data length is specified in bits and is added as a suffix right after the data type identifier. If the most significant bit is an INTEGER figure 1, this will be negative.

Question:  How is a 16-bit signed integer number represented in a CAN message using Little Endian format?","In a CAN message, a 16-bit signed integer number is represented using the Little Endian format by storing the least significant byte (LSB) of the number in the first byte of the data block and the most significant byte (MSB) in the subsequent byte. 

For example, consider the 16-bit signed integer number 4711 in decimal, which is 1267h in hexadecimal. The binary representation of 1267h is 0001 0010 0110 0111. 

In Little Endian format:
- The least significant byte (67h) is stored in the first byte (Byte 0) of the data block.
- The most significant byte (12h) is stored in the second byte (Byte 1) of the data block.

The data block for the CAN message would look like this:

| Byte 0 | Byte 1 | Byte 2 | Byte 3 | Byte 4 | Byte 5 | Byte 6 | Byte 7 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 67h    | 12h    | --     | --     | --     | --     | --     | --     |

Here, the bytes from Byte 2 to Byte 7 are not used and are typically not shown for clarity. The least significant bit (LSB) of the number is located in the least significant bit of Byte 0.

This representation ensures that the least significant byte is transmitted first, followed by the more significant bytes, adhering to the Little Endian format."

- Byte 0: 11h
- Byte 1: 47h
- Byte 2: 15h
- Byte 3: 88h

This arrangement ensures that the least significant byte (11h) is placed at the lowest memory address, followed by the next least significant byte (47h), and so on."

## 2.3.2. Representation Of A 16 Bit Integer Number Within A Data Block

The following example will explain the storage position of the ""Little Endian"" format. For this purpose, the transmission of an *INTEGER16***, e.g. of a 16 bit signed integer number, is** 
shown in the data block of a CAN message (8 bytes). The value to be transmitted will be shown as a hexadecimal number in order to show more clearly how the number is assigned to the bytes within the data block. <chunk_seperator> ## 2.4.2. Unsigned

UNSIGNED specifies unsigned whole numbers. This means that only positive figures can be displayed using this data type. The data length in bytes is added as a suffix. UNSIGNED32 is a whole numeric value without a sign and with a data length of 32 bits. 

<table_12>[{'Data type': 'Length [Bit]', 'Min.': 'Max.'}, {'-------------': '----------------', '--------': '------------'}, {'UNSIGNED8': '8', '0': '+255'}, {'UNSIGNED16': '16', '0': '+65.535'}, {'UNSIGNED32': '32', '0': '4294967295'}]</table_12>
For the illustration of data in a data block of more than 1 byte of length, the bit order has to be paid attention to; see chapter 2.3 Bit **order.** 

## 2.4.3. Boolean

The data type BOOLEAN is used to illustrate binary signals. These are signals which are not able to adopt more than two logical states. The data length in the memory may vary. If an individual binary signal is stored in the memory, the data type is usually an *UNSIGNED8*. <chunk_seperator> Byte 0 Byte 1 **Data bytes of the CAN message**

## 2.3.3. Display Of A 32 Bit Integer Number Within The Data Block

In the following example, the transmission of an *INTEGER***32, e.g. of a 32 bit signed integer** 
numeric value, within a data block of a CAN message (8 bytes) is shown in the ""Little Endian"" format. 

<table_10>[{'Numerical value decimal': '-2011871471d'}, {'-----------------------------': '----------------', '--------': '--------'}, {'Numerical value hexadecimal': '88154711h'}, {'Byte 0': 'Byte 1', 'Byte 2': 'Byte 3', 'Byte 4': 'Byte 5', 'Byte 6': 'Byte 7'}, {'No orientation  restrictions': 'No'}, {'INTEGER32': 'No orientation  restrictions', 'No orientation  restrictions': 'No orientation  restrictions', 'No': 'ori'}, {'11h': '47h', '15h': '88h'}]</table_10>
## 2.4. Data Types <chunk_seperator> For all data types, the display of numeric values described in the chapter *2.3 Bit* **order** is applicable to the storage within data blocks. 

## 2.4.1. Integer

INTEGER is the term for signed whole numbers whose data length may vary. Negative figures will be specified by a two's complement [NOT(<numeric value>)1]. The data length is specified in bits and is added as a suffix right after the data type identifier. If the most significant bit is an INTEGER figure 1, this will be negative. 

<table_11>[{'Data type': 'Length [Bit]', 'Min.': 'Max.'}, {'-------------': '------------'}, {'INTEGER8': '8', '-128': '+127'}, {'INTEGER16': '16', '-32.768': '+32.767'}, {'INTEGER32': '32', '-2147483648': '2147483647'}]</table_11>
Therefore, INTEGER16 means it is a signed whole number whose data length is 16 bits. For the illustration of data in a data block of more than 1 byte of length, the bit order has to be paid attention to; see chapter 2.3 Bit **order.** 

## 2.4.2. Unsigned <chunk_seperator> With the polling method, the speed of reading the EEPROM or FRAM is limited by the bandwidth of the SPI bus. The read **data rate that can be achieved is 267000 B/s and higher.**
The write speed achievable for the FRAM is 247000 B/s. The EEPROM write **speed cannot be** significantly improved by the polling because it is limited by the internal 5 ms programming delay (max), i.e. to 12800 B/s. The data rates for the polling method are not guaranteed because they depend on the frequency of the polling. The desired polling period is 1.6 us and shorter: If this is fulfilled, the specified data rates will surely be exceeded. In practice, however, the polling frequency depends on various CPU load conditions (such as the background interrupts) that are difficult to control. The given data rates are typical values verified by measurements in a test application. They should be met with a high degree of confidence in the majority of customer applications.

Question:  How are negative figures specified for the INTEGER data type?","Negative figures for the INTEGER data type are specified using the two's complement notation. In this system, the most significant bit (MSB) indicates the sign of the number. If the MSB is 1, the number is negative; if it is 0, the number is positive.

To obtain the two's complement of a number, you follow these steps:
1. **Invert all the bits** of the number (i.e., change all 0s to 1s and all 1s to 0s).
2. **Add 1** to the least significant bit (LSB) of the inverted number.

For example, for an 8-bit INTEGER:
- The positive number 5 is represented as 00000101 in binary.
- To find the two's complement (i.e., the negative representation) of 5:
  1. Invert the bits: 11111010
  2. Add 1: 11111010 + 1 = 11111011

Thus, -5 is represented as 11111011 in binary.

This method ensures that arithmetic operations can be performed consistently on both positive and negative numbers. The range of values for different INTEGER types is defined as follows:
- **INTEGER8**: -128 to +127
- **INTEGER16**: -32,768 to +32,767
- **INTEGER32**: -2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647

These ranges are derived from the bit lengths and the two's complement representation, where the MSB determines the sign of the number."

The data length is specified in bits and is added as a suffix right after the data type identifier. If the most significant bit is an INTEGER figure 1, this will be negative.

## 2.4.6. Array

ARRAY is a data type containing a variety of different entries/values. In an ARRAY, the entries are all of the same data type. The value entries in an ARRAY have the same signification but do not have the same content, i.e. a list of all the recently recorded device error numbers. For the individual entries, the simple data types described above, such as UNSIGNED32**, are used.** 
In the protocol described here, the first entry of the ARRAY indicates the number of existing entries. In an ARRAY, a maximum of 255 entries is allowed. This entry always has a subindex of 0 and is handled in a special way. <chunk_seperator> The individual value entries are accessed via a sub-index. The first sub-index for a value entry is 1. If a sub-index is accessed which is of higher value than the content of the subindex 0 (number of valid ARRAY entries) an error message will occur. 

## 2.4.6.1. Example Array

<table_15>[{'Index': 'Sub', 'Value': 'Name', 'Type': 'Access'}, {'---------': '------------------', '--------': '----------'}, {'1003h': 'Pre-defined error field'}, {'1003h': '0', '4': 'Number of errors', 'VAR': 'rw'}]</table_15>

The significance of each individual bit is explained in the related description. 

Status signals are often displayed as a bitfield. The representation of the content of a bitfield is usually in binary format, i.e. bit-oriented. The relevant characteristic is active if the bit which is related to the characteristic is active, 

![14_image_0.png]( The image features a square with an I inside of it. This square is placed on top of a larger square, which has a blue background. The smaller square containing the letter ""I"" appears to be a close-up or a detailed view of the letter. It seems like this could be a logo or a design element for a company or organization that uses the letter I as part of its branding.) which means it has the binary numeric value of 1 (TRUE). <chunk_seperator> In case of a bitfield, a few indications can be set synchronously. Therefore, for the evaluation of an individual indication, an appropriate masking should be applied for the bit field. 

The comparison with a simple constant may fail when having a combination of indications.

Question:  How is the significance of each individual bit in a BITFIELD explained?","The significance of each individual bit in a BITFIELD is explained through a related description that details the specific characteristic or signal that each bit represents. Each bit in the BITFIELD corresponds to a signal of the data type *BOOLEAN*, meaning that the bit can either be active (1, TRUE) or inactive (0, FALSE). 

When a bit is active, it indicates that the relevant characteristic or signal it represents is also active. This binary representation allows for a clear and concise way to display multiple status signals simultaneously. For example, if a bitfield is used to represent various status signals, each bit's state (either 0 or 1) will indicate whether the corresponding status signal is inactive or active, respectively.

To evaluate an individual indication within a bitfield, appropriate masking should be applied. This is necessary because a simple comparison with a constant may not be reliable when multiple indications are combined within the bitfield. Masking helps isolate the specific bit of interest, allowing for accurate evaluation of its state.

Additionally, unused bit positions within the bitfield may take on fixed values (either 0 or 1) depending on internal application states or may shift between states. These unused bits should be ignored for reliable evaluation to avoid misinterpretation of the bitfield's content.

In summary, the significance of each bit in a BITFIELD is defined by its corresponding characteristic or signal, with active bits indicating active characteristics. Proper masking is essential for accurate evaluation, and unused bits should be disregarded to ensure reliability."

Question:  In an ARRAY, what does the first entry indicate and how is it handled?","In an ARRAY, the first entry indicates the number of existing entries within the ARRAY. This entry is always assigned a subindex of 0 and is treated in a special manner. Specifically, it serves as a count of how many valid entries are present in the ARRAY. 

When accessing the individual value entries in the ARRAY, they are accessed via a sub-index, starting from 1. If an attempt is made to access a sub-index that is higher than the value of the first entry (subindex 0), which indicates the number of valid ARRAY entries, an error message will be generated. This mechanism ensures that only valid entries within the defined range are accessed, preventing errors and ensuring data integrity. 

For example, if the first entry (subindex 0) has a value of 4, it means there are four valid entries in the ARRAY, and these can be accessed using sub-indices 1 through 4. Attempting to access sub-index 5 or higher would result in an error."

## 2.4.6. Array

ARRAY is a data type containing a variety of different entries/values. In an ARRAY, the entries are all of the same data type. The value entries in an ARRAY have the same signification but do not have the same content, i.e. a list of all the recently recorded device error numbers. For the individual entries, the simple data types described above, such as UNSIGNED32**, are used.** 
In the protocol described here, the first entry of the ARRAY indicates the number of existing entries. In an ARRAY, a maximum of 255 entries is allowed. This entry always has a subindex of 0 and is handled in a special way. <chunk_seperator> The individual value entries are accessed via a sub-index. The first sub-index for a value entry is 1. If a sub-index is accessed which is of higher value than the content of the subindex 0 (number of valid ARRAY entries) an error message will occur.

The significance of each individual bit is explained in the related description. 

Status signals are often displayed as a bitfield. The representation of the content of a bitfield is usually in binary format, i.e. bit-oriented. The relevant characteristic is active if the bit which is related to the characteristic is active,

Question:  How does a RECORD differ from an ARRAY in terms of the data types of individual entries?","A RECORD and an ARRAY differ significantly in terms of the data types of their individual entries:

1. **Data Type Uniformity**:
   - **ARRAY**: All entries in an ARRAY must be of the same data type. This means that if an ARRAY is defined to hold UNSIGNED32 values, every entry within that ARRAY must be of the UNSIGNED32 type. This uniformity ensures that all elements in the ARRAY are consistent in terms of their data type.
   - **RECORD**: In contrast, a RECORD can contain entries of different data types. This means that within a single RECORD, you can have a mix of data types such as UNSIGNED32, BOOLEAN, REAL32, etc. Each entry in a RECORD can be of a different type, allowing for a more complex and varied data structure.

2. **Signification and Content**:
   - **ARRAY**: The entries in an ARRAY have the same signification but different content. For example, an ARRAY might store a list of error codes, where each entry represents a different error but all entries are of the same type (e.g., UNSIGNED32).
   - **RECORD**: The entries in a RECORD have different meanings and contents. For instance, a RECORD might store various attributes of a device, such as a vendor ID, product code, and serial number, each of which could be of a different data type and have a different significance.

3. **Structure and Access**:
   - **ARRAY**: The first entry of an ARRAY indicates the number of existing entries, and all entries are accessed via a sub-index starting from 1. If a sub-index higher than the number of valid entries is accessed, an error occurs.
   - **RECORD**: The first entry of a RECORD defines the highest existing sub-index, and not all sub-indices need to be used. Accessing a sub-index higher than the number of valid entries or a non-defined sub-index results in an error.

In summary, the primary difference lies in the uniformity of data types within an ARRAY versus the varied data types within a RECORD. This allows ARRAYS to be used for homogeneous collections of data, while RECORDS are suitable for heterogeneous collections where each entry can represent a different type of information."

For this purpose, the information is presented in the most compact way and provides crossreferences to the related chapters for detailed information. 

## 3.1.1. Canopen Default Settings

The signals in the measurement system which are typically pre-set for the process value transmission are explained below. Default settings depend on the model code and may deviate from the settings explained herein, particularly in devices with a modification (see user manual chapter ""Model code""→ ""Modification number"").

## 2.4.7.2. Example Record With A ""Definition Gap""

The following example shows the structure of an RECORD with a ""gap"" in the definition of the entries, see chapter*4.5.4.8 TPDO communication parameter***. In the example, the subindex 4 is not defined and the number of the highest value sub-index = 5.** 

## 2.4.8. String
Question:  How is a STRING represented in the protocol described in the context?","In the protocol described, a STRING is represented by the data type VISIBLE_STRING. This data type is used to visualize texts, where a STRING consists of a variety of individual characters, each generally representing one letter. In memory, these individual characters are represented by numeric values.

The specific representation of the STRING in the protocol can be illustrated through an example. For instance, the STRING ""save"" is represented in the following way:

- The characters of the STRING ""save"" are converted into their corresponding ASCII values.
- These ASCII values are then assigned to user data bytes as part of an SDO (Service Data Object) command.

The example provided in the context shows the following assignment:

<table_18>[{'Byte 4': 'Byte 5', 'Byte 6': 'Byte 7'}, {'---------------------------------------------------------------': '----------', '----------': '----------'}, {'61h': '76h'}, {'""a""': '""v""'}]</table_18>

In this table:
- The character 's' is represented by the ASCII value 73h.
- The character 'a' is represented by the ASCII value 61h.
- The character 'v' is represented by the ASCII value 76h.
- The character 'e' is represented by the ASCII value 65h.

Thus, the STRING ""save"" is stored in memory as the sequence of these ASCII values. The protocol uses this numeric representation to handle and transmit text data effectively. The detailed relationship between letters and their numeric values in memory is further described in chapter 7.1, which contains the ASCII Table."

A STRING is a particular data type used to visualise texts. A STRING consists of a variety of individual characters which generally represent one letter. In the memory, however, the individual characters are represented by a numeric value. In the protocol described here, the STRING is represented by the data type VISIBLE_STRING. The code, i.e. the relation between the letters and the numeric values in the memory, will be described in chapter 7.1 ASCII Table. <chunk_seperator> In addition to these primary components, there are several smaller electronic parts scattered around the circuit board, including a few near the top left corner and others at various points along the horizontal wire. The overall composition suggests that this is an intricate electronic device being assembled or worked on.)

## 2.4.8. String
Question:  What steps are required to change the device address (node ID) according to the context?","To change the device address (node ID) of the measurement system, you need to follow a specific sequence of actions. Here are the detailed steps:

1. **Set the device to network status ""Pre-Operational""**:
   - This step ensures that the device is in a state where it can accept configuration changes. Refer to chapter 4.4 ""Network Management"" and specifically to section 4.4.2 ""NMT"" for instructions on how to enter the pre-operational state.

2. **Enter the desired device address into Object 2003.2**:
   - The new device address (node ID) should be entered into the specified object. This involves using the Service Data Object (SDO) protocol to write the new address. Refer to the object ""Node ID"" and chapter 4.6.1 ""SDO"" for detailed instructions on how to perform this action.

3. **Save changes to non-volatile device memory**:
   - After entering the new device address, you need to save these changes so that they persist after a restart. This involves storing the parameters in the device's non-volatile memory. Refer to the description ""Store parameters"" and the object ""Save LSS parameters"" for the exact procedure.

4. **Restart the device**:
   - To apply the changes, the device must be restarted. This can be done in one of two ways:
     - Use the network management commands to reset the node, as described in chapter 4.4 ""Network Management"" and specifically in section 4.4.2 ""NMT"".
     - Alternatively, you can perform a power cycle by cutting the device's power supply and then reconnecting it.

5. **Alternative option for changing the node ID**:
   - If preferred, you can use the Layer Setting Services (LSS) protocol to change the node ID. This method is detailed in chapter 4.7 ""Layer setting services (LSS) Protocol"" and specifically in section 4.7.7 ""Example: setting the node ID and Baud rate via LSS"".

By following these steps, you can successfully change the device address (node ID) of the measurement system."

Question:  How is the resolution of a signal defined and what example is provided in the context?","The resolution of a signal is defined as the physical value of an individual bit of the numeric value. It represents the conversion between the numeric value of the data type and the physical size of the signal. Essentially, it determines how much a single bit change in the numeric value corresponds to a change in the physical measurement.

An example provided in the context illustrates this concept:
- Numerical value: 4711d
- Resolution: 0.01 °/bit

Using this resolution, the physical value can be calculated as:
\[ 4711d \times 0.01 \, \text{°/bit} = 47.11 \, \text{°} \]

This means that a numeric value of 4711, when multiplied by the resolution of 0.01 °/bit, results in a physical measurement of 47.11 degrees. This example helps to understand how the resolution translates numeric data into meaningful physical quantities."

Question:  How should the ""VFL status"" be evaluated for the intended use of the measurement system?","The ""VFL status"" should be evaluated in combination with the ""remaining service life"" process value signal for the intended use of the measurement system. This means that the status information provided by the ""VFL status"" bit field should be interpreted alongside the ""remaining service life"" signal to ensure accurate and meaningful assessment of the system's condition.

The ""remaining service life"" signal, which is output in hours, starts at a value of 9999 at the beginning of the filter element cycle. This value is continuously updated and corrected, especially when the remaining service life falls below 30% of the estimated total service life. When the remaining service life reaches 0, it indicates that the filter element should be replaced, and the calculation should be reset.

By evaluating the ""VFL status"" in conjunction with the ""remaining service life"" signal, users can determine the validity and reliability of the measurement data. This combined evaluation helps in making informed decisions about the maintenance and replacement of the filter element, ensuring the optimal performance of the measurement system."

## 3.4. Functionally Safe Process Data

The measurement systems described in this documentation (see chapter *1.1 Scope* **of applications) do not support functionally safe communication.** 

## 3.5. Parameter

In CANopen applications, parameters are comparable with the objects in an ""object dictionary"". Thus, all parameters of the measurement system are written to via the OD (see chapter *4.5The Object* **Dictionary).** 
The parameters described in this chapter are additional devices, device-specific parameters or parameters, whose behaviour deviates from the general protocol description.

Question:  How can the filter remaining lifetime calculation be reset in the measurement system?","The filter remaining lifetime calculation in the measurement system can be reset using an RPDO (Receive Process Data Object). Specifically, the process parameter object for this input signal should be mapped to the RPDO2 object. The relevant details for this input signal, named ""Vfl Reset,"" are as follows:

- **Data type**: INT32
- **Data length**: 32 bits
- **Mappable**: RPDO
- **Process value index**: 35FF
- **Default settings**: RPDO2

When the reset command is received via an RPDO, it is not acknowledged, meaning the user does not receive a confirmation that the reset has been performed. Additionally, the process data ""Operating data"" can also be reset via an SDO (Service Data Object), as detailed in chapter 3.5.2.6 of the documentation.

To summarize, the filter remaining lifetime calculation can be reset by mapping the process parameter object to RPDO2 and sending the reset command via an RPDO."

The parameters described in this chapter are additional devices, device-specific parameters or parameters, whose behaviour deviates from the general protocol description. 

## 3.5.1. Configuration Parameters

This chapter will explain configuration parameters, specific for this measurement system.

Question:  What must be done to change and save the node ID in the measurement system?","To change and save the node ID in the measurement system, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Write the New Node ID**: The new node ID must be written into the appropriate object. This is done by sending the new node ID along with the character string ""set"" to the object.

2. **Use SDO Download**: The process involves using an SDO (Service Data Object) download to write the new node ID. The SDO download command will include the new node ID and the string ""set"".

3. **Save the Change Permanently**: After writing the new node ID, it must be saved permanently. This is done by storing the new node ID in the object dictionary.

4. **Restart the Measurement System**: Finally, the measurement system must be restarted to apply the changes. The restart ensures that the new node ID is recognized and used by the system.

Here is an example of setting the node ID to 5h:

- **SDO Download Command**: The command will include the new node ID (5h) and the string ""set"".
- **Data Format**: The data format for the SDO download will look like this:
  - Byte 4: Node-ID (05h)
  - Byte 5: ""s"" (73h)
  - Byte 6: ""e"" (65h)
  - Byte 7: ""t"" (74h)

By following these steps, you can successfully change and save the node ID in the measurement system."

During power down (Terminal 15 **off), the ECU does not disconnect the timer and current loop**
sensor inputs. It is not recommended to supply the sensors permanently in order to prevent battery discharge. TTControl GmbH recommends one of the following 2 options:
1. Option 1**: Use a digital output for supplying the sensor. When the device is switched off, the**
ECU can perform an application-controlled shutdown, e. g., **in order to operate a cooling fan** to cool down an engine until the temperature is low enough or to store data in the non-volatile memory of the ECU. If the application controlled shut-down is finished, the ECU switches off and consumes less than 1 mA of battery current (including sensors). <chunk_seperator> ## 3.1.6.2 Probabilistic Values For Iec 61508 -

Question:  How does a unit change affect the scaling values of the process value at addresses 6121h and 6123h?","A unit change directly impacts the scaling values of the process value at addresses 6121h and 6123h. Specifically, when the physical unit of the process value is altered, the scaling values at these addresses are automatically adjusted to reflect the new unit of measurement.

For instance, if the unit is changed from bar to psi, the scaling values at 6121h (which represents the lower scaling value) and 6123h (which represents the upper scaling value) will be recalibrated to correspond to the new unit. This ensures that the process value is accurately represented in the new unit of measurement.

To illustrate, consider the following example:
- Initially, the process value is measured in bar, with a lower scaling value of 0 (at 6121h) and an upper scaling value of 600 (at 6123h) for a sensor with a measuring range up to 600 bar.
- If the unit is changed to psi, the scaling values will be adjusted to reflect the equivalent range in psi. This means that the values at 6121h and 6123h will be recalculated to match the new unit, ensuring that the process value remains consistent and accurate in the new unit of measurement.

This automatic adjustment is crucial for maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the process value when the unit of measurement is changed."

If there is no safety-critical analog input assigned to a specific 5 V sensor supply, but the overall system design requires diagnostic measures for the supply output, the application software can still read and evaluate the measured voltage level by calling the appropriate task function *IO_ADC_Get()* with the corresponding sensor supply parameter. <chunk_seperator> ![49_image_0.png]( The image displays a flowchart or diagram that illustrates various processes and their relationships.

Category: Comment ID: 920236 The 5 V sensor supplies' correct functioning is implicitly checked by the HY-TTC 500 platform's I/O driver, if at least one safety-critical analog input is allocated to the corresponding sensor supply. To that end, the analog feedback signal is permanently checked for its voltage level and the I/O driver triggers an error callback in case of deviations. If there is no safety-critical analog input assigned to a specific 5 V sensor supply, but the overall system design requires diagnostic measures for the supply output, the application software can still read and evaluate the measured voltage level by calling the appropriate task function *IO_ADC_Get()* with the corresponding sensor supply parameter. <chunk_seperator> ![49_image_0.png]( The image displays a flowchart or diagram that illustrates various processes and their relationships. There are multiple arrows pointing to different sections of the chart, indicating connections between them. <chunk_seperator> In the other section, there are several tables with rows of textual data, likely providing additional context or details about the subject matter.

Question:  How is the ""Pressure"" status supposed to be evaluated according to the context?","The ""Pressure"" status should always be evaluated in combination with the ""Pressure"" process value signal. This means that the status alone is not sufficient to determine the condition or validity of the pressure measurement; it must be considered alongside the actual process value signal for a comprehensive evaluation. This approach ensures that any potential errors or anomalies in the pressure measurement are accurately identified and addressed by cross-referencing the status with the process value signal. This method is detailed in the operating instructions for the measurement system, emphasizing the importance of this combined evaluation for accurate and reliable pressure monitoring."

In the following, the meaning of the identifiers of a BITFIELD are described. The bit 0 is set if the value is not valid due to an error in the measured value detection.
Question:  What information does the ""Device Temperature"" status provide and how is it structured?","The ""Device Temperature"" status provides information regarding the validity of the temperature signal from the device. This status is structured as a bit field, which is a way of representing multiple boolean conditions or flags within a single byte or word of data. 

Here is a detailed breakdown of the ""Device Temperature"" status:

1. **Validity of the Signal**: The primary purpose of the ""Device Temperature"" status is to indicate whether the temperature signal is valid. This is crucial for ensuring that the data being used or displayed is accurate and reliable.

2. **Bit Field Structure**: The status is organized as a bit field, meaning each bit within the byte can represent a different condition or flag. For example, bit 0 is specifically used to indicate if the value is not valid due to an error in the measured value detection. If bit 0 is set (i.e., it has a value of 1), it means there is an error, and the temperature value should not be trusted.

3. **Signal Properties**: The table associated with the ""Device Temperature"" status provides additional properties of the signal:
   - **Measurement Range Min/Max**: These fields are not specified for the ""Device Temperature"" status.
   - **Resolution**: Not specified.
   - **Offset**: Not specified.
   - **Data Type**: The data type for the ""Device Temperature"" status is UNSIGNED8, meaning it is an 8-bit unsigned integer.
   - **Data Length**: The length of the data is 8 bits.
   - **Mappable**: The status can be mapped to a TPDO (Transmit Process Data Object), which is used in CANopen networks to transmit process data.
   - **Process Value Index**: The index for the process value is 4613.1.
   - **Default Settings**: Not specified.

In summary, the ""Device Temperature"" status is a bit field that provides critical information about the validity of the temperature signal. It uses bit 0 to indicate errors in the measured value detection, ensuring that users can determine whether the temperature data is reliable. The status is represented as an 8-bit unsigned integer and can be mapped to a TPDO for transmission in a CANopen network."

Errors are recognised, administrated and provided by the measurement system in several different ways. On the one hand, there are errors occurring during processing of the process data and on the other hand, there are general device errors. All kinds of errors are provided as parameters (objects in the OD) and can be read out at any time; see chapter 4.6.1 SDO.

Supported: 
 General error register: *Error register* Specific error register: *Manufacturer status register* Error memory: Pre-defined error field
Question:  How does the measurement system react to process data errors?","When a process data error occurs in the measurement system, the system reacts in several specific ways:

1. **Error Marker Setting**: A corresponding error marker is set in the associated status. This means that the system flags the error within its status signals, which are then available for evaluation.

2. **Status Signal Evaluation**: The status signals related to process data errors should always be evaluated together with their corresponding process values. For instance:
   - The status signal ""VFL status"" should be evaluated with the ""Operating data"" signal.
   - The status signal ""Pressure value"" should be evaluated with the ""Pressure value"" signal.

3. **Operating Status Change**: Depending on the configuration of the error behavior, the measurement system may change its operating status. This is detailed in the network management settings, which dictate how the system should respond to different types of errors.

4. **Error Behavior Configuration**: The system's reaction to errors can be configured via the parameter ""Error behavior."" This allows for customization of the system's response to various error types, including whether it should continue operating, enter a safe state, or take other actions.

5. **General Error Management**: In addition to process data errors, the system also manages general device errors, such as communication or configuration errors. These are handled through a set of predefined error registers and memory fields, which store and report the errors.

6. **Error Events**: Errors that cause changes in the general error register are also sent as specific error events. These events are communicated through error messages and emergency (EMCY) messages, ensuring that the errors are promptly reported and can be addressed.

By following these steps, the measurement system ensures that process data errors are properly flagged, evaluated, and managed, maintaining the integrity and reliability of the system's operation."

All kinds of errors are provided as parameters (objects in the OD) and can be read out at any time; see chapter 4.6.1 SDO. 

## 3.7.1. Errror Behaviour

It depends on the error type and the device configuration of the error behaviour, how the measurement system will react to an occurring error. For process data errors, a corresponding error marker is set in the associated status. See chapter *3.3.3 ""VFL status""*. <chunk_seperator> <table_54>[{'Name': 'Index', 'Sub': 'Type', 'Acc': 'PDO'}, {'-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------': '---------------------------------------------------------------------', '------------------------------': '------------', '--------------------------------': '----------------------------------------'}, {'Manufacturer status  register': '1002h', '0': 'UNSIGNED32', 'ro': 'TP'}, {'Describes the device status  Error codes F: Device is functional for the customer  E: Error is sent via EMCY message  Bit no.

CAN is a Bus system. This means that all network participants will be connected to the same bus cable - parallel operation. On the contrary, the Ethernet, which is usually used in office communication, only connects one participant with one other at one time. For the connection between several participants, additional hardware, i.e. a switch, is necessary. This effort is not **necessary using CAN. How the network has to be organised is described in the following** chapter 4.2.3 *Topology*. 

CAN mainly has 2 signal lines: CAN-H and CAN-L. Data transmission is performed via these two lines, see chapter 4.2.2 *Signal* **level.** 
Each network participant is equal **in a CAN network, which means that each of the participants is able and allowed to send messages. If a participant sends, all the others receive** 
the message and decide on their own if it is relevant for them or not. <chunk_seperator> The following description makes no claim **to be complete, its only aim is**

Question:  How does the CAN bus system differ from Ethernet in terms of network participant connections?","The CAN bus system and Ethernet differ significantly in how they connect network participants:

1. **Connection Method**:
   - **CAN Bus System**: All network participants are connected to the same bus cable in a parallel operation. This means that every device on the network shares the same communication medium, allowing for direct communication between any two devices without the need for additional hardware.
   - **Ethernet**: Typically used in office communication, Ethernet connects one participant to another at a time. To connect multiple participants, additional hardware such as switches or hubs is required. This creates a more segmented network where each device communicates through the switch.

2. **Network Topology**:
   - **CAN Bus System**: The network is organized in a bus topology where all devices are connected to a single central cable. This setup is simple and does not require complex wiring or additional devices to manage connections.
   - **Ethernet**: Ethernet networks often use a star topology, where each device is connected to a central switch or hub. This requires more complex wiring and additional hardware to manage the connections between devices.

3. **Collision Handling**:
   - **CAN Bus System**: CAN handles collisions through a prioritization mechanism. Each message has a CAN ID, and the message with the highest priority (lowest CAN ID) is transmitted first. If two devices attempt to send messages simultaneously, the one with the higher priority will continue, and the other will wait and retry after the higher priority message is sent.
   - **Ethernet**: Ethernet traditionally uses a method called Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) to handle collisions. Devices listen to the network before sending data and detect collisions if they occur. When a collision is detected, devices stop transmitting and wait for a random period before attempting to resend.

4. **Signal Lines**:
   - **CAN Bus System**: Utilizes two signal lines, CAN-H and CAN-L, for data transmission. These lines are twisted pairs to reduce electromagnetic interference and ensure reliable communication.
   - **Ethernet**: Uses multiple pairs of twisted wires (typically four pairs in modern Ethernet cables) for data transmission, with each pair handling different aspects of the communication process.

5. **Hardware Requirements**:
   - **CAN Bus System**: Does not require additional hardware like switches for connecting multiple devices, making it simpler and more cost-effective for certain applications.
   - **Ethernet**: Requires switches or hubs to connect multiple devices, adding to the complexity and cost of the network setup.

In summary, the CAN bus system offers a simpler, more direct method of connecting multiple network participants through a shared bus cable, with built-in mechanisms for handling message prioritization and collisions. Ethernet, on the other hand, requires additional hardware to manage connections and uses a different method for collision detection and handling."

## 4.2.1. Wire Connections

CAN does not require any complicated wire connections. For the connection of the network participants one drilled pair of wires should be used. The pair of wires serves for the transmission of the signals CAN-H and CAN-L. Non-drilled cables should be avoided.

Question:  How does CAN handle competing access from multiple network participants to avoid collisions?","CAN (Controller Area Network) handles competing access from multiple network participants through a prioritization mechanism based on the CAN ID. Here’s a detailed explanation of the process:

1. **Equal Opportunity to Send**: In a CAN network, all participants are equal, meaning each participant has the ability to send messages. When a participant sends a message, all other participants receive it and determine if it is relevant to them.

2. **Competing Access**: When multiple participants attempt to send messages simultaneously, CAN employs a prioritization system to manage access and avoid collisions.

3. **Message Prioritization**: The prioritization is determined by the CAN ID, where lower numerical values have higher priority. For example, a message with CAN ID 0 has the highest priority.

4. **Bit-wise Arbitration**: Transmission in CAN networks is bit-oriented, with two signal statuses: recessive and dominant. The dominant status can overwrite the recessive one. During transmission, each participant reads back the bits it sends. If a participant detects that a bit it sent has been overwritten by a dominant bit from another participant, it recognizes that its message has lower priority and stops transmitting.

5. **Immediate Discontinuation and Reinitialization**: The participant whose message has been overwritten will immediately discontinue its transmission. It will then wait until the higher priority message has been completely transmitted before attempting to reinitialize its own transmission.

6. **No Message Loss**: This arbitration process ensures that no messages are lost. The higher priority message is transmitted first, and the lower priority message is sent afterward without any data loss.

By using this method, CAN effectively avoids collisions and ensures that higher priority messages are transmitted first, maintaining the integrity and efficiency of the communication network."

CAN is a Bus system. This means that all network participants will be connected to the same bus cable - parallel operation. On the contrary, the Ethernet, which is usually used in office communication, only connects one participant with one other at one time. For the connection between several participants, additional hardware, i.e. a switch, is necessary. This effort is not **necessary using CAN. How the network has to be organised is described in the following** chapter 4.2.3 *Topology*. 

CAN mainly has 2 signal lines: CAN-H and CAN-L. Data transmission is performed via these two lines, see chapter 4.2.2 *Signal* **level.** 
Each network participant is equal **in a CAN network, which means that each of the participants is able and allowed to send messages. If a participant sends, all the others receive** 
the message and decide on their own if it is relevant for them or not. <chunk_seperator> The following description makes no claim **to be complete, its only aim is**

## 4.2. Hardware Properties <chunk_seperator> In the case of a competing access of several participants, CAN will start prioritising messages**. This will avoid collisions to occur, as in other systems. The prioritising of messages** 
is carried out via the CAN ID, where the CAN ID 0 has the highest priority, see chapter *4.3.2* Meaning of the **CAN ID**. 

A network participant is not allowed to send, before a message has not been transmitted completely. If two participants start sending at the same time, the participant having the higher priority message will always ""win"". The structure of a message is described in chapter 4.3.1 *Structure principle of a* **CAN data message.** 
Transmission of information is bit-oriented in CAN networks and has a recessive and a dominant signal status. The dominant signal status is enabled to overwrite the recessive one. <chunk_seperator> ![96_image_0.png]( The image displays a long list of names with various descriptions underneath them.

Non-drilled cables should be avoided in CAN networks. This is because non-drilled cables are less effective in maintaining the integrity of the signal transmission, which can lead to potential issues in communication between network participants. Additionally, while almost all CAN connections provide an additional CAN_GND (ground) and CAN_SHLD (shield), the CAN signal lines generally do not require any shielding. However, the CAN_GND is used to bring the reference potential of the network participants to a common level, and CAN_SHLD serves as a connection for shielding the signal line if needed."

For the transmission, a symmetric voltage signal is used. This signal type has no direct reference with a signal mass, but only the voltage difference between both signal lines will be evaluated.

In the event of a dominant signal the signal line CAN-H will move to a higher voltage level and the CAN-L signal line will move to a lower voltage level.

Safety configuration for the ADC inputs. Stores all relevant safety configuration parameters for the **ADC inputs. The internal checker modules** verify that this inputs contain valid values Attention For the safety configuration of a 2 mode ADC channel, the following rules need to be fulfilled:
- The primary channel needs to specify a redundant channel (IO_ADC_08 .. **IO_ADC_23**)
at the redundant_channel **field.**
- The redundant channel must not reference a redundant channel by itself. Thus **IO_PIN_**
NONE **shall be used for the redundant channel.**
- **Every redundant channel can only be used once as redundant channel.**
- It's not allowed to have a redundant channel which is not used by a **primary channel.**
- If the ratiometric measurement mode is used, the primary and **the redundant channel**
must use different sensor supplies (but not **IO_SENSOR_SUPPLY_2**). <chunk_seperator> ## 4.2.3. Topology

As explained in chapter *4.2 Hardware* properties, **the topology of CAN is the Bus. This means, the CAN has a direct connection line, which reaches from the first to the last participant.** 
Each individual participant is directly connected to the signal lines CAN-H and CAN-L. At both ends of the main bus (the longest direct connection line) the bus line has to be terminated using a resistance of 120 Ohm. 

For the length of the main bus as well as for the length of the individual stub cable between the bus and the network participants, the maximum line lengths, described in chapter *4.2.5* Transmission **speed, should be strictly adhered to.** 

![59_image_1.png]( The image shows a diagram of an electrical system with multiple lines and connections. There are several busbars labeled ""busline"" that connect different parts of the system. Some of these buslines include ""busline 1,"" ""busline 2,"" and ""busline 3.""
Question:  What type of voltage signal is used for transmission in the context described, and what is its main benefit?","The type of voltage signal used for transmission in the context described is a symmetric voltage signal. This signal type does not have a direct reference with a signal mass; instead, it evaluates only the voltage difference between the two signal lines. The main benefit of using a symmetric voltage signal is its significant resistance to interference. Interfering signals will affect both signal lines equally, and since the evaluation is based on the voltage difference between the lines, these interferences are effectively canceled out when the difference is calculated. This makes the transmission more robust and reliable in environments with potential electrical noise."

Safety configuration for the ADC inputs. Stores all relevant safety configuration parameters for the **ADC inputs. The internal checker modules** verify that this inputs contain valid values Attention For the safety configuration of a 2 mode ADC channel, the following rules need to be fulfilled:
- The primary channel needs to specify a redundant channel (IO_ADC_08 .. **IO_ADC_23**)
at the redundant_channel **field.**
- The redundant channel must not reference a redundant channel by itself. Thus **IO_PIN_**
NONE **shall be used for the redundant channel.**
- **Every redundant channel can only be used once as redundant channel.**
- It's not allowed to have a redundant channel which is not used by a **primary channel.**
- If the ratiometric measurement mode is used, the primary and **the redundant channel**
must use different sensor supplies (but not **IO_SENSOR_SUPPLY_2**). <chunk_seperator> ## 4.2.3. Topology

As explained in chapter *4.2 Hardware* properties, **the topology of CAN is the Bus. This means, the CAN has a direct connection line, which reaches from the first to the last participant.** 
Each individual participant is directly connected to the signal lines CAN-H and CAN-L. At both ends of the main bus (the longest direct connection line) the bus line has to be terminated using a resistance of 120 Ohm. 

For the length of the main bus as well as for the length of the individual stub cable between the bus and the network participants, the maximum line lengths, described in chapter *4.2.5* Transmission **speed, should be strictly adhered to.** 

![59_image_1.png]( The image shows a diagram of an electrical system with multiple lines and connections. There are several busbars labeled ""busline"" that connect different parts of the system. Some of these buslines include ""busline 1,"" ""busline 2,"" and ""busline 3.""
Question:  How do the voltage levels of CAN-H and CAN-L change in the event of a dominant signal?","In the event of a dominant signal in a CAN (Controller Area Network) system, the voltage levels of the signal lines CAN-H (CAN High) and CAN-L (CAN Low) change in opposite directions. Specifically, the CAN-H line moves to a higher voltage level, while the CAN-L line moves to a lower voltage level. This results in a significant voltage difference between the two lines, typically around 2V. This differential signaling helps in effectively distinguishing the dominant signal from any potential noise or interference, as both lines are equally affected by external noise, which gets canceled out when the difference is evaluated."

Signal Level

For the transmission, a symmetric voltage signal is used. This signal type has no direct reference with a signal mass, but only the voltage difference between both signal lines will be evaluated. This type of signal transmission has significant benefits in the case of interfering signals, as these will affect both signal lines equally and will be excluded at the subtraction. 

In the event of a dominant signal the signal line CAN-H will move to a higher voltage level and the CAN-L signal line will move to a lower voltage level.

Safety configuration for the ADC inputs. Stores all relevant safety configuration parameters for the **ADC inputs. The internal checker modules** verify that this inputs contain valid values Attention For the safety configuration of a 2 mode ADC channel, the following rules need to be fulfilled:
- The primary channel needs to specify a redundant channel (IO_ADC_08 .. **IO_ADC_23**)
at the redundant_channel **field.**
- The redundant channel must not reference a redundant channel by itself. Thus **IO_PIN_**
NONE **shall be used for the redundant channel.**
- **Every redundant channel can only be used once as redundant channel.**
- It's not allowed to have a redundant channel which is not used by a **primary channel.**
- If the ratiometric measurement mode is used, the primary and **the redundant channel**
must use different sensor supplies (but not **IO_SENSOR_SUPPLY_2**). <chunk_seperator> ## 4.2.3. Topology

As explained in chapter *4.2 Hardware* properties, **the topology of CAN is the Bus. This means, the CAN has a direct connection line, which reaches from the first to the last participant.** 
Each individual participant is directly connected to the signal lines CAN-H and CAN-L. At both ends of the main bus (the longest direct connection line) the bus line has to be terminated using a resistance of 120 Ohm. 

For the length of the main bus as well as for the length of the individual stub cable between the bus and the network participants, the maximum line lengths, described in chapter *4.2.5* Transmission **speed, should be strictly adhered to.** 

![59_image_1.png]( The image shows a diagram of an electrical system with multiple lines and connections. There are several busbars labeled ""busline"" that connect different parts of the system. Some of these buslines include ""busline 1,"" ""busline 2,"" and ""busline 3.""
Question:  What are the two common connector types used with CAN, and what are their typical applications?","The two common connector types used with CAN (Controller Area Network) are:

1. **M12*1 5 pole plugs**:
   - **Application**: These connectors are typically used for sensors and actuators. The M12*1 5 pole plug is designed to provide a robust and reliable connection in industrial environments where sensors and actuators are commonly deployed. The pin configuration for this type of connector includes:
     - Pin 1: CAN_SHLD (Shield)
     - Pin 2: CAN_V+ (Power Supply)
     - Pin 3: CAN_GND (Ground)
     - Pin 4: CAN_H (CAN High)
     - Pin 5: CAN_L (CAN Low)

2. **DSUB 9 pole socket**:
   - **Application**: These connectors are typically used for controllers, such as PCs (Personal Computers) or PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers). The DSUB 9 pole socket is a standard connector type that provides a reliable interface for connecting controllers to the CAN network. The pin configuration for this type of connector includes:
     - Pin 1: CAN_L (CAN Low)
     - Pin 2: CAN_GND (Ground)
     - Pin 3: CAN_SHLD (Shield)
     - Pin 4: CAN_H (CAN High)
     - Pin 5: CAN_V+ (Power Supply)
     - Pins 6-9: Additional connections as needed for specific applications

These connectors ensure proper communication and power supply within the CAN network, facilitating the integration of various devices and controllers."

The type of message is defined by means of the CAN-ID (see chapter 4.3.2 *Meaning of the* CAN ID) and the receiver is able to set a filter, to define which message it wants to receive - just like setting (filtering) a frequency aiming to receive a particular radio station.

 **FOOTER - Contains the checksum, a message confirmation as well as an identifier which marks the end of the entire message.** 
A particular feature of CAN message is that they can also represent a valid information without the user data. How many user data bytes a message may contain, is informed by the DLC of the HEADER. This section defines the amount of data bytes in the area of the DATA and can receive the applicable values 0-8. This involves that the max. length of the user data is 8 bytes or 64 bit.

## 3.4 Mise À Jour Du Firmware

Les réglages enregistrés sur l'HMG 4000 peuvent, dans certaines circonstances, <chunk_seperator> The shortest possible message (11 bit CAN ID, DLC = 0) has a bit length of 47 bit. This message would require 188 µs for a Baud rate of 250 kbit/s and a maximum of 4800 messages of this type could be transmitted per second (~90 % Bus load).
Question:  What impact does the Baud rate have on the maximum length of the wiring in a CAN network?","The Baud rate, or transmission speed, has a significant impact on the maximum length of the wiring in a CAN (Controller Area Network) network. This relationship is crucial because the Baud rate determines how fast data is transmitted over the network, and higher speeds generally require shorter wiring lengths to maintain signal integrity and avoid data loss or corruption.

Here are the key points regarding the impact of Baud rate on wiring length:

1. **Inverse Relationship**: There is an inverse relationship between the Baud rate and the maximum length of the bus wiring. As the Baud rate increases, the maximum allowable length of the wiring decreases. This is because higher transmission speeds are more susceptible to signal degradation over longer distances.

2. **Specific Lengths for Different Baud Rates**: The table provided outlines specific maximum bus lengths for various Baud rates. For example:
   - At a Baud rate of 1000 kbit/s, the maximum bus length is 25 meters.
   - At a Baud rate of 500 kbit/s, the maximum bus length increases to 100 meters.
   - At a Baud rate of 125 kbit/s, the maximum bus length can be as long as 500 meters.
   - At a very low Baud rate of 10 kbit/s, the maximum bus length can extend up to 1000 meters.

3. **Stub Cable Lengths**: The length of stub cables, which are the short connections branching off the main bus, also depends on the Baud rate. For instance:
   - At 1000 kbit/s, the maximum stub length is 0.3 meters.
   - At 500 kbit/s, the maximum stub length is 0.8 meters.
   - At 125 kbit/s, the maximum stub length is 3 meters.

4. **Bit Length**: The bit length, which is the time it takes to transmit a single bit, also varies with the Baud rate. For example:
   - At 1000 kbit/s, the bit length is 1 µs.
   - At 500 kbit/s, the bit length is 2 µs.
   - At 125 kbit/s, the bit length is 8 µs.

These factors illustrate that careful consideration must be given to the Baud rate when designing a CAN network, as it directly influences the physical layout and length of the wiring. Ensuring that the wiring lengths are within the specified limits for the chosen Baud rate is essential for maintaining reliable communication and avoiding issues such as signal reflections, attenuation, and data errors."

The type of message is defined by means of the CAN-ID (see chapter 4.3.2 *Meaning of the* CAN ID) and the receiver is able to set a filter, to define which message it wants to receive - just like setting (filtering) a frequency aiming to receive a particular radio station.

The data message is the most important message in a CAN network. It is used for the <chunk_seperator> **HEADER - The message head synchronises between the network participants** 
and informs the receiver about the content and the length of the message. 

 **DATA - This section is for the user data, i.e. the information which is supposed to** 
be transmitted from the sender to the receiver. 

 **FOOTER - Contains the checksum, a message confirmation as well as an identifier which marks the end of the entire message.** 
A particular feature of CAN message is that they can also represent a valid information without the user data. How many user data bytes a message may contain, is informed by the DLC of the HEADER. This section defines the amount of data bytes in the area of the DATA and can receive the applicable values 0-8. This involves that the max. length of the user data is 8 bytes or 64 bit. Example for a CAN message without user data; DLC = 0: <chunk_seperator> Il existe une exception dans laquelle la dérive du point zéro est automatiquement effacée. C'est toujours le cas lorsque le capteur raccordé au canal correspondant présente une plage de mesure différente de celle pour laquelle la dérive du point zéro a été réglée.

Question:  How are messages in a CAN network received by participants, and what term is used to describe this type of message?","In a CAN (Controller Area Network) network, messages are received by all participants. This means that when a message is sent by one participant, it is broadcasted to all other participants in the network. Each participant receives the message, and it is up to the individual participants to filter and process the messages they are interested in. This type of message is referred to as a ""broadcast."" The term ""broadcast"" is used because it is analogous to a radio station sending out information that all radio receivers can hear or receive."

Question:  What are the three sections of a CAN data message, and what is the purpose of each section?","A CAN data message is structured into three main sections: the Header, the Data, and the Footer. Each section serves a distinct purpose in the communication process within a CAN network.

1. **Header**:
   - **Purpose**: The Header synchronizes the communication between network participants and provides essential information about the message. It informs the receiver about the content and the length of the message.
   - **Details**: The Header includes the CAN-ID, which defines the type of message and allows the receiver to filter and select the messages it wants to receive. It also contains the Data Length Code (DLC), which specifies the number of data bytes in the Data section.

2. **Data**:
   - **Purpose**: This section contains the actual user data that is being transmitted from the sender to the receiver.
   - **Details**: The Data section can hold up to 8 bytes (64 bits) of user data. The amount of data is defined by the DLC in the Header. This section is crucial for the exchange of information between network participants.

3. **Footer**:
   - **Purpose**: The Footer ensures the integrity and completeness of the message.
   - **Details**: It includes a checksum for error detection, a message confirmation, and an identifier that marks the end of the entire message. The checksum helps in verifying that the message has not been corrupted during transmission.

These sections work together to ensure that data is accurately and efficiently transmitted across the CAN network, with mechanisms in place for synchronization, data integrity, and message identification."

Question:  How does the CAN ID affect the priority of messages in a CAN network?","In a CAN (Controller Area Network) system, the CAN ID plays a crucial role in determining the priority of messages. The priority mechanism is based on the value of the CAN ID, with lower values indicating higher priority. Here’s a detailed explanation of how this works:

1. **Message Arbitration**:
   - When multiple devices on the CAN network attempt to send messages simultaneously, the CAN protocol uses a process called arbitration to determine which message gets transmitted first.
   - During arbitration, each device sends its CAN ID bit by bit. The CAN protocol uses a non-destructive bitwise arbitration method, where each bit is either dominant (logical 0) or recessive (logical 1).

2. **Dominant and Recessive Bits**:
   - Dominant bits (0) override recessive bits (1). This means that if one device sends a dominant bit while another sends a recessive bit, the dominant bit will take precedence on the bus.
   - Devices monitor the bus while transmitting. If a device sends a recessive bit but detects a dominant bit, it knows that another device with a higher priority message (lower CAN ID) is transmitting, and it will stop its own transmission.

3. **Priority Determination**:
   - The priority of a message is directly related to the numerical value of its CAN ID. The lower the CAN ID, the higher the priority of the message.
   - For example, a CAN ID of 0 has the highest priority, meaning it will always win arbitration over any other CAN ID.

4. **Network Management**:
   - The CAN ID is used to manage the network effectively. For instance, the Network Management (NMT) messages, which are critical for the operation of the network, are assigned the highest priority with a CAN ID of 0.
   - This ensures that NMT messages are transmitted immediately, without delay, ensuring the smooth operation and control of the network.

5. **CANopen Protocol**:
   - In the CANopen protocol, the CAN ID can be structured to include both the importance of the message (service ID) and the address of the participant (Node ID).
   - For example, the CAN ID for the first process data object is defined by 180h + Node ID, where 180h is the base ID for process data objects.

6. **Service Prioritization**:
   - Different services in the CANopen protocol are assigned specific CAN IDs to ensure proper prioritization. For instance, emergency messages (EMCY) and synchronization messages (SYNC) have their own predefined CAN IDs to ensure they are transmitted with appropriate priority.

In summary, the CAN ID is fundamental in determining the priority of messages in a CAN network. Lower CAN IDs have higher priority, ensuring that critical messages are transmitted first. This prioritization mechanism is essential for the efficient and reliable operation of the CAN network, especially in real-time systems where timely communication is crucial."

the message and decide on their own if it is relevant for them or not. 

In the case of a competing access of several participants, CAN will start prioritising messages**. This will avoid collisions to occur, as in other systems. The prioritising of messages** 
is carried out via the CAN ID, where the CAN ID 0 has the highest priority, see chapter *4.3.2* Meaning of the **CAN ID**. <chunk_seperator> For the longest possible message (29 bit CAN-ID, DLC = 8) the length of the message at 250 kbit/s (4 µs /bit) would result as follows: Message length = 129 bit, transmission time per message = 516 µs (~0,5 ms) and approx. 1760 messages per second (~90 % Bus load).

## 4.3.2. Meaning Of The Can Id

As described in the chapter 4.2 *Hardware* properties, **CAN is able to prioritise incoming** 
messages. The CAN ID is decisive for that. It is sent within the first section of the HEADER, 
as has been treated in chapter 4.3.1 *Structure principle of a* **CAN data message. As the** 
network participant may not send before complete transmission of a message, the CAN ID can be used to prioritise, applying the mechanism of the recessive and the dominant signal <chunk_seperator> pression, la température et le débit, qui sont reconnus automatiquement par l'appareil HMG 3010 et dont la plage de mesure et l'unité peuvent être réglées - la variante la plus conviviale. Il est également possible de raccorder des capteurs SMART à l'appareil HMG 3010. Ceux-ci sont représentatifs d'une génération de capteurs HYDAC capables d'indiquer de nombreuses grandeurs de mesure différentes. Ces capteurs sont également reconnus automatiquement par l'appareil HMG 3010 via HSI et les valeurs de mesure sont affichées à l'écran avec l'unité correspondante. Au total, le HMG 3010 peut représenter jusqu'à 32 canaux de mesure. Selon son type, le capteur possède une mémoire interne. Des valeurs de mesure enregistrées sur une période prolongée sont sauvegardées dans cette mémoire. En outre, il est possible de modifier, en fonction du type de capteur, les paramètres préréglés et de les enregistrer dans la mémoire interne en tant que configuration du capteur. <chunk_seperator> ![63_image_0.png]( The image features a black and white square with an ""I"" written on it.

The ""Network Control"" service is performed via the *Master - Device***communication model.** 
The CANopen Manager (controller) generally takes over the role of the NMT Master As this service makes the decisions on the interaction between the participants in the network, it has been assigned the most important priority; see chapter 4.3.2 *Meaning of the* CAN ID and 4.3.1 *Structure principle of a* **CAN data message.**

Question:  How does CANopen structure the CAN ID to combine importance with the participant's address?","CANopen structures the CAN ID by combining the importance of the message (service ID) with the participant's address (Node ID). This structured approach allows for the prioritization of messages based on their importance and the specific node they are associated with. Here’s how it works:

1. **Service ID and Node ID Combination**: In CANopen, the CAN ID is often referred to as the COB ID (Communication Object Identifier). The COB ID can either be the CAN ID itself or a combination of the basic CAN ID and the Node ID. This combination results in a unique CAN ID for each message during the device's lifetime.

2. **Priority Determination**: The priority of a message is determined by the value of the CAN ID. Lower CAN IDs have higher priority. For example, a CAN ID of 0 has the highest possible priority. This prioritization mechanism ensures that critical messages are transmitted first.

3. **Example of Structured CAN ID**: For instance, the CAN ID of the first process data object (PDO) is defined by the formula 180h + Node ID. This means that the base CAN ID for PDOs is 180h, and the specific Node ID of the device is added to this base value to form the complete CAN ID.

4. **Service-Specific CAN IDs**: Different services in CANopen have predefined CAN IDs. For example, the Network Management (NMT) message, which has the highest priority, is assigned a CAN ID of 0. Other services like PDO, SDO (Service Data Object), SYNC, TIME, EMCY (Emergency), Heartbeat, and LSS (Layer Setting Services) have their specific CAN IDs structured similarly.

5. **Table of CANopen Services and CAN IDs**: The most important CANopen services and their assignment to CAN IDs are listed in tables. These tables indicate which services are active in different operational states (Pre-Operational, Operational, Stopped).

By structuring the CAN ID in this manner, CANopen ensures that messages are prioritized correctly and that each participant's address is uniquely identified, facilitating efficient and organized communication within the network."

## 6.13.2 Field Documentation
Question:  How is the heartbeat protocol implemented and what does it report?","The heartbeat protocol in the CANopen network is implemented using the Producer-Consumer model. This model involves one participant (the producer) sending out heartbeat messages to inform all other participants (the consumers) within the network about its current operating state. The heartbeat message is sent on a cyclical basis, meaning it is transmitted at regular intervals.

To activate the heartbeat protocol, the ""Producer heartbeat time"" object must be configured. This object allows the heartbeat to be activated and the repeat rate (the interval at which the heartbeat messages are sent) to be set. If a heartbeat consumer detects the absence of a heartbeat message within the expected interval, it will notify its superordinate application software about this event. The application software is then expected to take appropriate action in response to the missing heartbeat.

The heartbeat message itself has a data length of one byte, which indicates the current state of the participant. The possible states reported by the heartbeat message include:

- ""Operational"" mode: This indicates that the participant is fully operational and functioning as expected.
- ""Pre-Operational"" mode: This indicates that the participant is in a pre-operational state, which is typically used for configuration and diagnostics before the device becomes fully operational.

For example, a heartbeat signal from a device with Node ID = 1 that is currently in the ""Pre-Operational"" mode would be represented as follows:

- CAN ID: 701h (indicating the Node ID = 1)
- Status: 7Fh (indicating the ""Pre-Operational"" state)

This example is illustrated in the table below:

<table_64>
| Byte 0 | Byte 1 | Byte 2 | Byte 3 | Byte 4 | Byte 5 | Byte 6 | Byte 7 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| CANID  | Status |        |        |        |        |        |        |
| 701h Rx| 7Fh    |        |        |        |        |        |        |
</table_64>

In summary, the heartbeat protocol is a crucial mechanism for monitoring the operational status of participants in a CANopen network, ensuring that all devices are functioning correctly and allowing for timely detection and response to any issues that may arise."

Question:  Describe the sequence of events in the example NMT behavior involving a participant with Node ID = 1.","The sequence of events in the example NMT behavior involving a participant with Node ID = 1 is as follows:

1. **Initialization and Boot-Up:**
   - The participant (Node ID = 1) is connected to a CANopen manager (NMT Master).
   - At the beginning of the recording, the participant is re-initialized (power ON).
   - After successful initialization, the device sends its ""boot-up"" message to indicate that it is ready to operate.

2. **Start of Operation:**
   - After a defined time period, the NMT Master sends a command to start all participants. This command is represented by the NMT message with Byte 0 set to `01h` (Start node) and Byte 1 set to `0d` (indicating the message is processed by all participants).
   - The device (Node ID = 1) starts sending its process data, specifically the TPDO1 (Transmit Process Data Object 1).

3. **Transition to Pre-Operational State:**
   - After waiting for another defined period, the NMT Master sends a command to change the state of the participants to ""Pre-Operational"". This command is represented by the NMT message with Byte 0 set to `80h` (Enter Pre-Operational) and Byte 1 set to `0d`.
   - The device (Node ID = 1) terminates the sending of its process data as it transitions to the Pre-Operational state.

4. **Writing to Object 5300:**
   - The NMT Master writes to the object 5300 in the device (Node ID = 1).
   - The device confirms that the writing access has been successful, indicating that it has received and processed the write command correctly.

5. **Transition to Stopped State:**
   - After waiting for another defined period, the NMT Master sends a command to change the state of the participants to ""Stopped"". This command is represented by the NMT message with Byte 0 set to `02h` (Stop node) and Byte 1 set to `0d`.
   - The device (Node ID = 1) transitions to the Stopped state.

6. **Attempt to Write to Object 5300 in Stopped State:**
   - The NMT Master again attempts to write to the object 5300 in the device (Node ID = 1).
   - The inquiry is not responded to by the device, indicating that the device is in the Stopped state and is not processing the write command.

Throughout this sequence, the NMT Master controls the state transitions of the participant (Node ID = 1) and performs specific actions such as writing to an object and monitoring the device's responses. The participant's behavior changes according to the commands received from the NMT Master, demonstrating the typical NMT behavior in a CANopen network."

With reset, the entire contents of the memory including the reference phase is deleted. The sensor begins a new referencing phase once the voltage supply is re-connected and once the fluid temperature of 40°C (default setting) is exceeded for the first time. All parameter settings remain unchanged in the sensor. 

A reset can be carried out in different ways:

Question:  What happens when the manager attempts to write onto the object 5300 in the device with node ID 1?","When the manager attempts to write onto the object 5300 in the device with node ID 1, the device does not respond to the inquiry. This lack of response indicates a communication issue between the CANopen manager and the device. The network connection between the CANopen manager and the device has been disturbed, as noted in the context.

The CANopen protocol uses Emergency (EMCY) messages to signal errors. In this scenario, the device might be in an error state, which could be indicated by specific EMCY messages. For instance, if the device were in a ""CAN in error passive"" state, the EMCY message would be:

- EMCY-EC: 8120h (indicating ""CAN in error passive"")
- Error Register: 11h (indicating bits ""Generic"" and ""Communication error"" are set)
- MSEF: 00h (no additional information)

Alternatively, if the device had a device-specific error, the EMCY message would be:

- EMCY-EC: FF00h (indicating a device-specific error)
- Error Register: 91h (indicating bits ""Generic"" and ""device-specific error"" are set, and ""Communication error"" is still set)
- MSEF: 10h (indicating a measuring range override recognized)

Given that the device does not respond, it is likely in an error state, and the manager should check the EMCY messages to diagnose the specific issue. The error could be related to communication problems or a device-specific error, as indicated by the error codes and registers."

With reset, the entire contents of the memory including the reference phase is deleted. The sensor begins a new referencing phase once the voltage supply is re-connected and once the fluid temperature of 40°C (default setting) is exceeded for the first time. All parameter settings remain unchanged in the sensor. 

A reset can be carried out in different ways: 
7.1 Reset Button Button on the device. 

For this purpose, please loosen the screw (Torx T20) and press the button using a pointed object (pen or similar). Ensure the power supply is switched on. The button must be pressed for 2 seconds.

Question:  What does the EMCY-EC code 8120h indicate in the context of the HYDAC Filtertechnik GmbH linear position transmitter?","The EMCY-EC code 8120h in the context of the HYDAC Filtertechnik GmbH linear position transmitter indicates that the CAN network is in an ""error passive"" state. This is a specific error condition within the CANopen protocol, which signifies that the device has encountered communication issues but is still operational, albeit with limited functionality.

The details of this error condition are as follows:
- **EMCY-EC 8120h**: This hexadecimal code translates to the ""CAN in 'error passive'"" state.
- **Error Register 11h**: This value in the error register indicates that both the ""Generic"" and ""Communication error"" bits are set. This means that the device has recognized a general error as well as a specific communication error.
- **MSEF 00h**: The Manufacturer Specific Error Field (MSEF) contains no additional information in this case, as indicated by the value 00h.

In summary, the EMCY-EC code 8120h alerts the user that the device has detected communication errors that have caused it to enter an error passive state, which is a less severe error state compared to an ""error active"" state but still requires attention to resolve the communication issues."

Question:  How is an object index and sub-index represented in the addressing scheme described?","In the addressing scheme described, an object index and sub-index are represented using a combination of hexadecimal and decimal notation. The object index is always represented in hexadecimal format, while the sub-index is represented in decimal format. The two are separated by a period (""."").

For example:
- The notation ""1018.2"" refers to the object with index 1018 (in hexadecimal) and sub-index 2 (in decimal). This specific example points to the Identity object with the Product code.
- Another example is ""1005.0"", which refers to the object with index 1005 (in hexadecimal) and sub-index 0 (in decimal). This points to the COB-ID SYNC object.

This addressing scheme allows for precise identification of specific values within a structured data type by indicating both the main object index and the relevant sub-index."

With reset, the entire contents of the memory including the reference phase is deleted. The sensor begins a new referencing phase once the voltage supply is re-connected and once the fluid temperature of 40°C (default setting) is exceeded for the first time. All parameter settings remain unchanged in the sensor.

Question:  What does the access type ""rww"" signify in terms of object access types?","The access type ""rww"" signifies ""read write, process write"" or ""read write, process read"" in terms of object access types. Here's a detailed explanation of each:

1. **Read Write, Process Write (rww)**:
   - **Read Write**: The object can be both read from and written to. This means that the data contained within the object can be accessed and modified.
   - **Process Write**: If the object is marked as ""mappable,"" it can only be mapped to a PDO (Process Data Object) for writing onto it. This means that the object can be included in a PDO, which is used to transmit data to the device.

2. **Read Write, Process Read (rww)**:
   - **Read Write**: Similar to the above, the object can be both read from and written to.
   - **Process Read**: If the object is marked as ""mappable,"" it can only be mapped to a PDO for reading from it. This means that the object can be included in a PDO, which is used to receive data from the device.

In summary, the ""rww"" access type allows for both reading and writing operations on the object. Additionally, if the object is mappable, it can be included in a PDO for either writing data to the device (process write) or reading data from the device (process read)."

4.5.1.4. Object serving as process data content Some entries in the OD can be used for the transmission via a process value (PDO). The main advantage is that, doing this, the content of the object does not have to be requested explicitly via a SDO command any more, but is permanently available in the context of process data transmission.

## 4.5.3. Od Example
Question:  What is the purpose of activating the feature ""Store parameters""?","The purpose of activating the feature ""Store parameters"" is to enable the permanent storage of object changes. When this feature is activated, any modifications made to the objects are saved persistently, ensuring that the changes are retained even after the device is powered off or reset. This is crucial for maintaining the consistency and reliability of the system's configuration and settings over time.

In the context of objects serving as functions, the activation of this feature involves assigning a particular activation value to the object. Writing this value triggers the function associated with the object, in this case, the function to store parameters permanently. This process ensures that the system's state and configuration are preserved, which is essential for the stable operation of devices that rely on these parameters for their functionality.

For example, in a device that uses an inclination sensor, the parameters related to the sensor's calibration, sensitivity, and other operational settings would need to be stored permanently to ensure accurate and consistent performance. Activating the ""Store parameters"" feature would save these settings, preventing the need for reconfiguration after each power cycle.

In summary, the ""Store parameters"" feature is vital for the long-term stability and reliability of a system by ensuring that any changes to the object's parameters are saved permanently."

## 4.5.3. Od Example
Question:  How does the object property ""mappable"" affect the transmission of object content?","The object property ""mappable"" significantly influences the transmission of object content by allowing the content to be transmitted via a Process Data Object (PDO). This property indicates that the content of the object can be included in the PDO mapping process, which is a method used to define how data is transmitted in a real-time communication system.

Here’s a detailed explanation of how the ""mappable"" property affects the transmission of object content:

1. **Real-Time Data Transmission**:
   - When an object is marked as ""mappable,"" its content can be included in the PDO. This means that the data can be transmitted in real-time without the need for explicit requests. This is particularly useful in systems where timely data exchange is critical, such as in industrial automation and control systems.

2. **Efficiency**:
   - By using PDOs, the system can transmit multiple pieces of data in a single communication cycle. This reduces the overhead associated with sending individual Service Data Object (SDO) requests for each piece of data, thereby improving the efficiency of the communication process.

3. **Permanent Availability**:
   - The content of mappable objects is permanently available in the context of process data transmission. This means that once the mapping is configured, the data is continuously updated and transmitted according to the PDO configuration, ensuring that the latest data is always available to the receiving nodes.

4. **Configuration**:
   - The configuration of which objects are mappable and how they are mapped to PDOs is typically defined in the device’s Electronic Data Sheet (EDS). This configuration includes specifying the index and sub-index of the objects, the data type, and the access rights.

5. **Example**:
   - For instance, in the provided context, the object ""Error register"" with index 1001h is marked as mappable (TP). This means that the error status of the device can be transmitted in real-time via a Transmit PDO (TPDO), allowing other devices on the network to monitor the error status without needing to send individual requests.

6. **Mapping Process**:
   - The process of mapping involves defining which objects are included in the PDO and how they are structured. This is done through the PDO mapping parameters, which specify the exact layout of the data within the PDO. The chapters *4.6.2 PDO* and *4.6.2.3 PDO Mapping* would provide more detailed information on how this mapping is configured.

In summary, the ""mappable"" property allows for the efficient and real-time transmission of object content via PDOs, ensuring that critical data is always available and reducing the communication overhead in the system. This property is essential for optimizing the performance and reliability of communication in systems that require timely data exchange."

## 4.5.3. Od Example
Question:  What information is provided in the ""Communication profile area"" of the OD?","The ""Communication profile area"" of the Object Dictionary (OD) provides all the necessary settings for communication with the device. This includes both manufacturer-related and device-related information, such as the serial number, current error reports, and settings for process data transmission. The object index range for this area is from 1000h to 1FFFh.

The ""Communication profile area"" is further subdivided into different sub-areas to enhance readability and organization. These sub-areas are essential for the protocol description and include:

1. **General Communication Objects (Object index range: 1000h - 1029h)**:
   - This section summarizes objects that provide information on the device status, such as error management.
   - Specific objects defined in the device profiles are included here, such as:
     - **Error register (1001h)**: This object provides information on the device's error status. It is of type UNSIGNED8, read-only (ro), and can be mapped to a Transmit Process Data Object (TPDO).
     - **Error behaviour (1029h)**: This object details the device's behavior in case of errors.

The ""Communication profile area"" is crucial for ensuring that all parameters necessary for effective communication with the device are well-documented and accessible. This includes the general area describing all parameters for communication, as outlined in CiA 301 ""General communication objects (object index range: 1000h - 1029h)"".

Question:  What details are provided in the table showing the general structure of the OD in a device?","The table showing the general structure of the Object Dictionary (OD) in a device provides a detailed overview of various entries and their properties. Here are the key details provided in the table:

1. **Index and Subindex**: These columns indicate the specific location of the object within the OD. The index is a hexadecimal value that uniquely identifies each object, while the subindex further specifies the particular element within the object.

2. **Value**: This column shows the possible content of an object that can be read out via addressing using the <index>.<subindex> format by means of SDO (Service Data Object) commands from an existing device.

3. **Name**: This column provides the name of the object, giving a clear indication of what the object represents or its function within the device.

4. **Object Type**: This column describes the type of the object, such as VAR (variable), ARRAY, or RECORD, which indicates the structure and nature of the data contained within the object.

5. **Access**: This column specifies the access rights for the object, such as:
   - **rw** (read/write): The object can be both read from and written to.
   - **ro** (read-only): The object can only be read.
   - **const** (constant): The object is a constant value and cannot be changed.

6. **Data Type**: This column indicates the data type of the object, such as UNSIGNED32, STRING, etc., which defines the format and size of the data stored in the object.

The table also includes specific examples of objects, such as:
- **1005h**: COB-ID SYNC, which is a variable (VAR) with read/write access and an UNSIGNED32 data type.
- **1008h**: Manufacturer device name, which is a constant (const) string (STRING).
- **1018h**: This index includes multiple subindices, such as:
  - **0**: Highest sub-index supported, which is a constant variable.
  - **1**: Vendor ID, which is a read-only UNSIGNED32 variable.
  - **2**: Product code, which is a read-only UNSIGNED32 variable.
  - **3**: Revision number, which is a read-only UNSIGNED32 variable.
  - **4**: Serial number, which is a read-only UNSIGNED32 variable.

The table provides a structured and detailed view of the OD, allowing users to understand the properties and access rights of each object within the device. This information is crucial for configuring and interacting with the device, ensuring proper communication and functionality."

This object is an expanded error state compared with the ""Error register"". The lowest 16 bits (bit 0 - 15) contain the device-specific error identifiers. In the case of an error, these 16 bit will be implemented in the error memory as an additional information as well. The higher bits (bit 16 - 31) can contain additional status information. 

If an EMCY message occurs (see chapter *4.4.5 EMCY***), the lower level 16 bits (bit 0 - 15)**

Question:  How is the Manufacturer status register 1002h different from the Error register 1001h?","The Manufacturer status register (1002h) and the Error register (1001h) serve different purposes and provide varying levels of detail regarding the device's error status.

### Error Register (1001h)
- **Index**: 1001h
- **Type**: UNSIGNED8
- **Access**: Read-only (ro)
- **Purpose**: This register provides a summary of the device's error status.
- **Bit Definitions**:
  - **Bit 0**: Generic error (indicates a general device failure)
  - **Bit 1**: Current not supported
  - **Bit 2**: Voltage not supported
  - **Bit 3**: Temperature not supported
  - **Bit 4**: Communication error (indicates an error in CAN communication)
  - **Bit 5**: Device profile specific (details in device profile documentation)
  - **Bit 6**: Reserved
  - **Bit 7**: Manufacturer-specific error (details in Manufacturer status register)

### Manufacturer Status Register (1002h)
- **Index**: 1002h
- **Type**: UNSIGNED32
- **Access**: Read-only (ro)
- **Purpose**: This register provides a more detailed and expanded error state compared to the Error register.
- **Bit Definitions**:
  - **Bits 0-15**: Device-specific error identifiers (these bits are also included in the error memory and transmitted in the manufacturer-specific part of an EMCY message)
  - **Bits 16-31**: Additional status information (specific to the manufacturer and device)

### Key Differences
1. **Detail Level**:
   - The Error register (1001h) provides a high-level summary of the error status using 8 bits, each representing a different type of error or status.
   - The Manufacturer status register (1002h) offers a more detailed view with 32 bits, where the lower 16 bits provide specific error identifiers and the higher 16 bits can contain additional status information.

2. **Bit Allocation**:
   - The Error register uses 8 bits, with each bit having a predefined meaning related to general errors, communication errors, and manufacturer-specific errors.
   - The Manufacturer status register uses 32 bits, with the lower 16 bits dedicated to device-specific error identifiers and the higher 16 bits available for additional status information.

3. **Usage in EMCY Messages**:
   - The Error register's status is part of the EMCY message, providing a quick overview of the error type.
   - The Manufacturer status register's lower 16 bits are included in the manufacturer-specific part of the EMCY message, offering detailed error information.

4. **Purpose and Scope**:
   - The Error register is designed to give a quick, high-level indication of the device's error status.
   - The Manufacturer status register is intended to provide a comprehensive and detailed error state, useful for in-depth diagnostics and troubleshooting.

In summary, while the Error register (1001h) gives a broad overview of the device's error status, the Manufacturer status register (1002h) provides a detailed and expanded error state, including specific error identifiers and additional status information."

Question:  How can the number of errors in the Pre-Defined Error Field 1003H be reset?","To reset the number of errors in the Pre-Defined Error Field 1003H, you need to set the object ""Number of errors"" (1003h, sub-index 0) to 0. This action will delete any error memory that may exist. It is important to note that values other than 0 may not be written into this object. Here is a step-by-step guide:

1. Access the object ""Number of errors"" at index 1003h, sub-index 0.
2. Write the value 0 to this object.

By performing this action, the current number of error messages saved in the error memory will be reset to 0, effectively clearing the error list."

Activate/deactivate heartbeat ""Producing"" The device is able to send heartbeat messages on a cyclic basis; see chapter *4.4.3 Heartbeat*.
Question:  What is the purpose of the COB-ID Emergency Message 1014H?","The COB-ID Emergency Message 1014H serves a critical role in the CANopen communication protocol, specifically for handling emergency messages (EMCY). The primary purpose of this object is to define the Message ID (COB-ID) used for transmitting EMCY messages. These messages are crucial for signaling error conditions or emergency states within the network.

Here are the key points regarding the COB-ID Emergency Message 1014H:

1. **Message Identification**: It specifies the CAN-ID that will be used for sending EMCY messages. This ID is essential for ensuring that the emergency messages are correctly identified and processed by other nodes in the network.

2. **Customizable CAN-ID**: The COB-ID can be set via an SDO (Service Data Object) command to a specific CAN-ID. This allows for flexibility in network configuration, enabling the assignment of a unique CAN-ID for EMCY messages if needed.

3. **Node ID Independence**: When the COB-ID is set to a particular CAN-ID, the automatic expansion of the COB-ID by an active Node ID is deactivated. This means that the specified CAN-ID will be used consistently for EMCY messages, regardless of the Node ID of the device. This feature is useful for maintaining a fixed identifier for emergency messages, which can simplify error handling and diagnostics.

4. **Default Settings**: If the COB-ID is set to 0, the default settings are reinstated. The default setting typically combines the Node ID with a base value (e.g., $Nodeid+80H), ensuring that each node has a unique EMCY message identifier based on its Node ID.

In summary, the COB-ID Emergency Message 1014H is designed to manage the identification and transmission of emergency messages within a CANopen network, providing both flexibility and consistency in how these critical messages are handled."

Question:  What does the object index range 1400h - 15FFh define in the context of RPDO communication parameters?","The object index range 1400h - 15FFh defines the parameters for RPDO (Receive Process Data Object) communication. This range specifies how the RPDOs, which are the process data received from the device, will be transmitted. The specific details of the RPDO communication parameters include:

1. **Index 1400h**: This is the first RPDO communication parameter. Each RPDO has its own structure for defining its transmission type.
2. **COB-ID**: This parameter is used for calculating the operating CAN ID under which the RPDO will be accepted and received.
3. **Transmission Type**: This parameter defines the type of transmission for the RPDO. The possible values include:
   - 0: Acyclic synchronous
   - 1: Synchronous with each SYNC
   - 2: Synchronous with every 2nd SYNC
   - n - 240: Synchronous with every nth SYNC
   - 254: Event-controlled manufacturer-specific event options
   - 255: Event-controlled device-specific event options
4. **Inhibit Time (1400h 3)**: This parameter, defined as UNSIGNED16 and read/write (rw), specifies the minimum delay for RPDO processing as a multiple of 100 µs. A value of 0 deactivates this blocking period.
5. **Event Timer (1400h 5)**: This parameter, also defined as UNSIGNED16 and read/write (rw), sets the monitoring interval for RPDO processing. If the timer is set to a value greater than 0, the time between two RPDOs will be measured and reported to the device software if exceeded. The time is defined as a multiple of 1 ms.

Question:  What does the object index range 1600h - 17FFh define in the context of RPDO mapping parameters?","The object index range 1600h - 17FFh defines which actual process value parameter objects will be transmitted within one of the available RPDOs (Receive Process Data Objects). This range is crucial for specifying the mapping of process data to RPDOs, essentially determining how the data received from the device is structured and transmitted.

The mapping parameters within this range indicate the specific process data objects that will be included in the RPDOs. The objects used for transmission are identified by the characteristic ""PDOMapping"" set to 1 (TRUE). This ensures that only the designated process data objects are mapped and transmitted via the RPDOs.

For a detailed description of the PDO mapping structure, one should refer to chapter 4.6.2.3 PDO Mapping. Additionally, to change the PDO mapping, a defined process must be followed, as outlined in the relevant chapters of the documentation. This ensures that any modifications to the mapping are done systematically and correctly, maintaining the integrity and functionality of the communication process."

Question:  What happens when the COB-ID is set to a particular CAN-ID via an SDO command?","When the COB-ID is set to a particular CAN-ID via an SDO command, the mechanism for the automatic expansion of the COB-ID by an active Node ID is deactivated. This means that the predetermined CAN ID will always be used for the transmission of a TPDO, regardless of the Node ID. Essentially, the TPDO will transmit using the specified CAN ID without incorporating the Node ID into the COB-ID.

Additionally, if the COB-ID is set to 0, the default settings will become effective again. This reverts the system to its original configuration where the Node ID is included in the COB-ID.

Furthermore, by setting Bit 31 of the COB-ID, the TPDO can be deactivated, meaning it will no longer be transmitted. This is indicated by the COB-ID value $NODEID+C0000180h, which signifies that the TPDO is inactive.

In summary, setting the COB-ID to a specific CAN-ID via an SDO command fixes the CAN ID for TPDO transmission, bypasses the Node ID, and allows for deactivation of the TPDO by manipulating Bit 31 of the COB-ID."

Question:  What does the inhibit time parameter 1800h 3 define when the transmission type is 254 or 255?","The inhibit time parameter 1800h 3, when the transmission type is set to 254 (FEh) or 255 (FFh), defines the minimum waiting delay before a TPDO (Transmit Process Data Object) is sent after an event has occurred. This parameter is crucial in managing the frequency of TPDO transmissions in response to events. 

Specifically, the inhibit time parameter helps to reduce the number of TPDOs sent in the case of frequently occurring events by imposing a minimum delay between consecutive transmissions. This delay is defined as a multiple of 100 microseconds (µs). If the value of the inhibit time is set to 0, the minimum waiting delay is deactivated, meaning that TPDOs can be sent immediately after each event without any enforced delay. 

In summary, the inhibit time parameter 1800h 3 ensures that there is a controlled and manageable interval between TPDO transmissions, which is particularly useful in scenarios where events occur in rapid succession."

Some older devices and devices which are part of the HPT 1000 and HTT 
1000 series by HYDAC Filtertechnik GmbH have functions for the configuration of the Node ID and Baud rate which may differ from the functions in the description below. 

Possible differences are described in the device-specific part of the documentation in chapter *3.5.2 Manufacturer-specific configuration* **parameters.**
In addition, the devices provide the configuration of the Node ID and Baud rate via the LSS

## 4.5.5. Manufacturer-Specific Profile Area
Question:  What does the ""TPDO mapping parameter"" object define in the context of TPDOs?","The ""TPDO mapping parameter"" object defines the structure and content of the process value parameter objects that are to be transmitted by a specific Transmit Process Data Object (TPDO) in a CANopen network. Each TPDO has its own mapping parameter object, which typically supports up to 9 sub-entries. The first sub-entry specifies the number of valid sub-entries, indicating how many process value parameter objects will be transmitted by the TPDO. The subsequent sub-entries define the actual process value parameters to be transmitted.

Here are the key points about the ""TPDO mapping parameter"" object:

1. **Number of Mapped Objects**: The first sub-entry (1A00.0) is an UNSIGNED8 value that indicates the number of valid sub-entries. This number determines how many process value parameter objects will be included in the TPDO transmission. For example, if this value is set to 2, the first two subsequent sub-entries must contain valid process value parameter object references.

2. **Sequential Order**: The entries must be filled in a strictly sequential order without any gaps. This means that if the number of mapped objects is set to 2, the first two sub-entries must be valid, and there cannot be any empty or skipped sub-entries between them.

3. **Deactivation**: If the number of mapped objects is set to 0 (1A00.0 = 0), the transmission of the TPDO is deactivated. This is useful for reconfiguring the TPDO mapping, as changes to the PDO mapping require the PDO transmission to be deactivated first.

4. **Process Value Parameter Object Reference**: Each subsequent sub-entry (e.g., 1A00.1, 1A00.2, etc.) contains a reference to a process value parameter object. This reference is encoded in a 32-bit value that includes the object index, sub-index, and data length of the referenced process value parameter object. For example, a value of 60100010h in sub-entry 1A00.1 indicates that the process value parameter object at index 6010, sub-index 0, with a data length of 16 bits (INTEGER16) will be transmitted by the TPDO.

In summary, the ""TPDO mapping parameter"" object is crucial for defining which process value parameters are included in a TPDO and how they are structured within the CAN message. It ensures that the TPDO transmits the correct data in a specified order and format."

The ""TPDO mapping parameter"" object usually supports up to 8 + 1 different sub-entries. The first entry defines the amount of valid sub-entries, while the following entries define the values to be transmitted subsequently (process value parameters). Number of mapped objects in PDO 1A00h 0 **UNSIGNED8 rw** 
The value of this object defines how many of the subsequent sub-entries are valid, which means, how many process value parameter objects will be transmitted in this TPDO. <chunk_seperator> exactly specified in the CiA 301. The most common implementation used by HYDAC Filtertechnik GmbH is described below. 

Some older devices and devices which are part of the HPT 1000 and HTT

## 4.5.5. Manufacturer-Specific Profile Area
Question:  How is the first reference object for the process value parameter object in TPDO defined and encoded?","The first reference object for the process value parameter object in a Transmit Process Data Object (TPDO) is defined and encoded in a specific manner to ensure proper transmission of data within the CANopen network. Here is a detailed explanation of how it is defined and encoded:

### Definition:
1. **Object Index and Sub-Index**: The first reference object is identified by the object index `1A00H` and sub-index `1`. This is a 32-bit unsigned integer (`Unsigned32`) that is read-write (`Rw`).

2. **Byte Position**: The byte position in the data block of the CAN message for this TPDO is byte 0. This means that the data for this process value parameter object starts at the first byte of the CAN message data block.

3. **Data Length**: The required data length in the CAN data block depends on the data length of the data type of the referenced process value parameter object. This ensures that the correct amount of data is allocated for the process value parameter object within the CAN message.

### Encoding:
The content of the first reference object is encoded into three sections:
1. **Object Index (16 bits)**: This part of the encoding specifies the index of the process value parameter object that will be transmitted. It is a 16-bit value.

2. **Sub-Index (8 bits)**: This part specifies the sub-index of the process value parameter object. It is an 8-bit value.

3. **Data Length (8 bits)**: This part specifies the data length of the process value parameter object. It is also an 8-bit value.

### Example:
To illustrate, consider the example provided:
- `1A00.1 = 60100010h`
  - Here, `6010` is the object index.
  - `00` is the sub-index.
  - `10h` (16 in decimal) is the data length.

This means that the first reference object for the TPDO is the process value parameter object located at index `6010` and sub-index `00`, with a data length of 16 bits (or 2 bytes).

### Process:
1. **Sequential Order**: The entries need to be filled in a strictly sequential order without leaving any gaps. This ensures that the data is transmitted in the correct sequence and format.

2. **Activation/Deactivation**: If the number of mapped objects (`1A00.0`) is set to `0`, the transmission of the TPDO is deactivated. Changes to the PDO mapping require the PDO transmission to be deactivated first.

### Summary:
The first reference object for the process value parameter object in a TPDO is defined by the object index `1A00H` and sub-index `1`, and it is encoded into three sections: object index, sub-index, and data length. This encoding ensures that the correct process value parameter object is referenced and transmitted within the CANopen network, starting at byte 0 of the CAN message data block."

## 1.4 Contenu De La Livraison <chunk_seperator> has 1A01 and so on. The following section describes the first object, the structure of further possible objects corresponds with this description. 

## Tpdo Mapping Parameter 1 1A00H **Record**

Each available TPDO has its own structure for the definition of the process value parameter objects to be transmitted by this PDO. The ""TPDO mapping parameter"" object usually supports up to 8 + 1 different sub-entries. The first entry defines the amount of valid sub-entries, while the following entries define the values to be transmitted subsequently (process value parameters). Number of mapped objects in PDO 1A00h 0 **UNSIGNED8 rw** 
The value of this object defines how many of the subsequent sub-entries are valid, which means, how many process value parameter objects will be transmitted in this TPDO. <chunk_seperator> exactly specified in the CiA 301. The most common implementation used by HYDAC Filtertechnik GmbH is described below. 

Some older devices and devices which are part of the HPT 1000 and HTT 
1000 series by HYDAC Filtertechnik GmbH have functions for the configuration of the Node ID and Baud rate which may differ from the functions in the description below. 

Possible differences are described in the device-specific part of the documentation in chapter *3.5.2 Manufacturer-specific configuration* **parameters.**
In addition, the devices provide the configuration of the Node ID and Baud rate via the LSS 
protocol, see chapter4.7 Layer setting services (LSS) Protocol. 

## Node Id 2001H **Array**

Object for the device address management; see chapter *4.4 Network Management*. 

The standard setting of the device address is described in chapter *3.1.1 CANopen default* settings.

## Note: <chunk_seperator> <table_81>[{'Name': 'Index', 'Sub': 'Type', 'Acc.': 'PDO'}, {'-------------': '---------', '-------': '------------', '--------': '-------'}, {'NMT startup': '1F80h', '0': 'UNSIGNED32'}]</table_81>
Defining the start behaviour of the device; see also chapter *4.4 Network Management*. 

Bit 2 0: Device remains in the *""Pre-Operational""* **state after successful initialisation and** 
waits for a *""Start Node"" command*. 

 1: Device automatically switches to ""Operational"" state after successful initialisation. 

Note**: This behaviour does not correspond with the definition in the CiA 302 Part 2,** 
the logic has been inverted with respect to the behaviour described therein. 

Bit 3 1: always needs to be set. Bit x 0: all further bit may not be set. 0000 0008h → 8d device waits in ""Pre-Operational"" (common default settings) 0000 000Ch → 12d Device automatically switches to ""Operational"" state. 

## 4.5.5. Manufacturer-Specific Profile Area
Question:  What is the significance of the object index range 2000 - 5FFF in the manufacturer-specific profile area?","The object index range 2000 - 5FFF in the manufacturer-specific profile area is significant because it designates a range of objects that are typically specific to the manufacturer and the device. These objects are not standardized across all devices but are instead tailored to the specific functionalities and requirements of the devices produced by a particular manufacturer. 

In this context, the objects within this range are used to manage and configure various device-specific settings and parameters that are essential for the operation and customization of the device. For instance, the management of the Node ID and Baud rate, which are critical settings for CANopen devices, falls within this range. These settings are crucial for ensuring proper communication and network management within a CANopen network.

The manufacturer-specific profile area allows for flexibility and customization, enabling manufacturers to implement unique features and configurations that are not covered by the standard CANopen profiles. This customization can include additional diagnostic information, specialized control parameters, or proprietary communication protocols that enhance the functionality and performance of the device.

In summary, the object index range 2000 - 5FFF is a designated area for manufacturer-specific objects, providing the necessary flexibility for manufacturers to implement device-specific features and configurations that are essential for the optimal operation of their products."

## 4.5.5.2. Additional Manufacturer-Specific Measurement Channels

Some devices offer additional measurement channels which complete the standard measurement variables, such as pressure in a pressure sensor, which increases the benefit of the device. Additional manufacturer-specific measurement channels are able to provide ""real"" measurement signals with a defined specification in the data sheet, such as accuracy or temperature coefficient, but also internal signals, such as the device temperature. 

The device-specific section of the documentation under chapter 3.5.5 *Additional manufacturer-specific measurement* **channels. also provides information on whether a device has manufacturer-specific measurement** <chunk_seperator> is missing'}, {'CONFIG IO_E_DRV_SAFETY_CYCLE_RUNNING': 'the init function was called after the task begin function'}, {'IO_E_INTERNAL_CSM': 'an internal error occurred'}, {'IO_E_UNKNOWN': 'an unknown error occurred'}]</table_177>
Question:  What are the two objects available for the management of the device Baud rate?","For the management of the device Baud rate, there are two objects available:

1. **Active Baud rate (2002h 1)**: This object is of type **UNSIGNED16 ro** (read-only) and represents the currently active Baud rate of the device.

2. **Pending Baud rate (2002h 2)**: This object is of type **UNSIGNED16 rw** (read-write) and is used to set the desired change of the Baud rate. Changes to this object will not take effect until they have been saved into the non-volatile memory and the device has been restarted using the ""Reset Node"" command or its power supply has been cut.

Under normal operation, the values of the objects 2002.1 (Active Baud rate) and 2002.2 (Pending Baud rate) are identical. If there is a request for a new Baud rate that has not yet become active, the two objects will have different values."

Question:  How can changes to the pending Baud rate object 2002h 2 be made effective?","To make changes to the pending Baud rate object 2002h 2 effective, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Save the Changes to Non-Volatile Memory**: First, the desired changes to the pending Baud rate must be saved into the device's non-volatile memory. This ensures that the changes are retained even if the device is powered off.

2. **Restart the Device**: After saving the changes, the device must be restarted for the new Baud rate to take effect. This can be done in one of two ways:
   - **Reset Node Command**: Issue a ""Reset Node"" command to the device. This command will restart the device and apply the new Baud rate settings.
   - **Power Cycle the Device**: Alternatively, you can cut the power supply to the device and then restore it. This power cycling will also restart the device and apply the new Baud rate settings.

Under normal operation, the values of the active Baud rate object (2002h 1) and the pending Baud rate object (2002h 2) are identical. However, if there is a request for a new Baud rate and the changes have not yet been made active, these two objects will have different values until the steps above are completed."

Question:  What additional information can be found in chapter 3.5.5 regarding manufacturer-specific measurement channels?","Chapter 3.5.5 provides detailed information on additional manufacturer-specific measurement channels that enhance the standard measurement variables of devices, such as pressure in a pressure sensor. These additional channels offer significant benefits by providing ""real"" measurement signals with defined specifications, such as accuracy or temperature coefficient, as well as internal signals like device temperature.

The chapter includes the following specific details:

1. **Device-Specific Information**: It outlines whether a device has manufacturer-specific measurement channels and which measured variables correspond to which ""sub-index"" or channel settings. This helps users understand the capabilities and configurations of their specific devices.

2. **Measurement Signal Specifications**: It provides the defined specifications for the measurement signals, ensuring users know the accuracy, temperature coefficient, and other relevant parameters of the additional channels.

3. **Support and Availability**: The chapter clarifies that not all devices will support these additional measurement channels fully or at all. It indicates that the availability of these objects may vary, and some objects might be only partly available or not available at all.

4. **Process Value Transfer**: It explains that the process values of these additional channels can be transferred via a Transmit Process Data Object (TPDO), which is essential for integrating these measurements into the broader system.

5. **Function Principle**: The chapter describes the function principle of these objects based on the device profile CiA 404, ensuring that users understand how these additional channels operate within the context of the device's overall functionality.

Overall, chapter 3.5.5 provides comprehensive information on the additional manufacturer-specific measurement channels, their specifications, availability, and integration into the device's measurement system."

Question:  What is the significance of the object with index 3613 in the context of the device's measurement channels?","The object with index 3613, labeled as ""MS Status,"" holds significant importance in the context of the device's measurement channels. This object provides status information for each additional manufacturer-specific measurement channel. The status information is crucial as it helps in understanding the operational state and any potential issues related to the measurement channels.

Here are the key points about the object with index 3613:

1. **Status Information**: The primary role of this object is to convey the status of the additional manufacturer-specific measurement channels. The specific meaning of the status word depends on the device, which implies that it could indicate various states such as normal operation, error conditions, or other relevant statuses defined by the manufacturer.

2. **Sub-Index Structure**: The object is structured as an array, where each sub-index corresponds to a specific measurement channel. For example:
   - **3613.0**: This sub-index, of type UNSIGNED8 and marked as ""const,"" indicates the highest sub-index supported. It essentially tells how many measurement channels are being monitored.
   - **3613.1**: This sub-index, of type UNSIGNED8 and marked as ""ro TP"" (read-only, transmit process data), provides the status information for the first additional manufacturer-specific measurement channel.
   - Further sub-indices (e.g., 3613.2, 3613.3, etc.) would provide status information for subsequent measurement channels if they exist.

3. **Read-Only Access**: The status information provided by this object is read-only, meaning it can be accessed and read by the user or system but cannot be modified. This ensures the integrity and reliability of the status data.

4. **Transmission of Process Data**: The ""TP"" (transmit process data) attribute indicates that the status information is part of the process data that can be transmitted, allowing for real-time monitoring and diagnostics.

In summary, the object with index 3613 is essential for monitoring the health and operational status of the additional manufacturer-specific measurement channels. It provides a structured and reliable way to access status information, which is critical for maintaining the proper functioning and troubleshooting of the device."

Question:  How is the zero-offset value of the additional manufacturer-specific measurement channel adjusted according to the context?","The zero-offset value of the additional manufacturer-specific measurement channel is adjusted using the ""MS Autozero"" function. This function is represented by the object 3616. When this function is activated, it sets the zero-offset value to the current signal value of the corresponding measurement channel. 

To perform this adjustment, the content of the ""MS input offset"" object (3615) is set to the current signal value of the ""MS input MV"" object (3610) at the moment the ""MS Autozero"" object (3616) is opened. This process is initiated by writing the character string ""zero"" (6F72657Ah) to the ""MS Autozero"" object. 

In summary, the zero-offset adjustment is done by:
1. Opening the ""MS Autozero"" object (3616).
2. Writing the character string ""zero"" to this object.
3. The system then sets the ""MS input offset"" (3615) to the current value of the ""MS input MV"" (3610)."

This structure is used to pass the configuration for safety critical application to the IO Driver.

Note Note that the hereby defined values are the configuration values of the TMS570 watchdog configuration values! The processor offers a unique watchdog triggering technic, which does not based on a +/- window manner. In order to support a command **period centric +/- watchdog** window approach the underlying implementation - due to processor limitations - will distort the window size that was requested through the safety configuration. To calculate your exact window size (in %) you can use the following formula:
actual_window_size = {400/(200-choosen_wsize)-2}∗100 where *choosen_wsize* **is one of the** *SAFETY_CONF_WINDOW_SIZE* **below (6.25%,12.5%,25%,etc).** Example, with a windows size choose 25%, the actual size will be 28,57%.

## 4.5.7. Eds Electronic Data Sheet
Question:  What does the entry 1001.0 ""*Error register*"" in the EDS file example represent?","The entry 1001.0 ""*Error register*"" in the EDS file example represents an object within the Electronic Data Sheet (EDS) that is used to log error conditions of the device. Here is a detailed breakdown of its attributes:

- **ParameterName**: *Error register* - This is the name of the object, indicating that it is used to register errors.
- **ObjectType**: 0x7 - This indicates that the object type is a variable (VAR). In the context of EDS, 0x7 corresponds to a single value entry.
- **DataType**: 0x5 - This specifies the data type of the object. In this case, 0x5 corresponds to UNSIGNED8, meaning the error register is an 8-bit unsigned integer.
- **AccessType**: ro - This defines the access type for the object. ""ro"" stands for read-only, indicating that the value of the error register can be read but not written to.
- **PDOMapping**: 1 - This indicates that the object is mappable to a Process Data Object (PDO). A value of 1 means it is included in the PDO mapping.

In summary, the entry 1001.0 ""*Error register*"" is a read-only 8-bit unsigned integer that logs error conditions and is mappable to a PDO for real-time data exchange."
"You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the context that the user gives to answer the question. Treat the context as your internal knowledge, hence do not explicitly mention the ""context"" in your answer like ""Based on the provided context..."".If your answer relates to any image description given below, you should refer explicitly to the image ID in your answer with the format [image_id.png].Give a long and detailed answer.","Context: Whether access will be permitted or not to a particular object, can be determined from the object authorisation (see chapter *4.5.1.2 Object* access types) and from the current operation status of the device. See chapter *4.4.1 Overview network* **conditions.** 
The data type of the object (see chapter *4.5.7 EDS Electronic Data Sheet* and *DataType*) 
controls the process of the SDO communication. All objects whose data type is 32 bit and shorter can be read or written to directly by means of a single SDO command ""expedited"" ,

CANopen provides different types of data communication. Each of these communication types will not be available at each operation condition; see chapter *4.4.1 Overview network* conditions. 

## 4.6.1. Sdo

SDO, abbr. for ""Service data o**bject"" offers the opportunity for direct access to the individual** 
objects in the OD; see chapter *4.5 The Object* **Dictionary.** 
It is possible to have read only and read/write access to the object. During access, the object address serves as an indicator, which object the access should be given to; see chapter 4.5.1.1 Addressing. <chunk_seperator> For the SDO the Client/Server access is used as a communication type, see chapter **4.3.5.3** Request - Response**. The server is always the network participant, whose objects will be** 
accessed - which is the device to write on in this case. The client is usually a superordinate The client communicates a ""request"" command to the server, saying what it is intending to do and the server always responds by sending a ""response"" command, indicating whether the access has been successful or if an error has occurred, see chapter **4.6.1.5 SDO abort** transfer (abort). 

## 4.6.1.1. Structure Of The Sdo Command

Below, please find a description of the general structure of all SDO messages. The commands depends on the used access type. 

![105_image_0.png]( The image features a black and white square with an I-shaped symbol on it. The I is prominently displayed in the center of the square. The overall design gives off a modern and minimalist vibe.) <chunk_seperator> If the server detects an error while processing a request command, it will report it to the client sending an ""SDO abort transfer"" response. The data field of the SDO command serves to transmit a cancel code (error number). The numeric value is shown as a *UNSIGNED32*and the *Bit order* **is to be adhered to.** The command code is always 80h. 

This example shows the attempt to write a value into the object 7654 ""**manufacturer-specific** 
profile area""**. As this object is not existing on that device, the SDO command is cancelled by** 
means of a cancel repsonse. <chunk_seperator> ## 7.15.2.423 #Define Io_Pwm_33 Io_Pin_126

Question:  What types of data communication does CANopen provide, and are they available at all operation conditions?","CANopen provides various types of data communication, each tailored to specific needs and functionalities within the network. However, not all types of data communication are available under all operation conditions. The availability of these communication types is contingent upon the current operation status of the device and the network conditions, as outlined in chapter 4.4.1.

One of the primary types of data communication in CANopen is the Service Data Object (SDO). SDOs allow for direct access to individual objects within the Object Dictionary (OD). This access can be either read-only or read/write, depending on the object authorization and the current operational status of the device. The SDO communication process is controlled by the data type of the object, with objects of 32 bits or shorter being accessed directly through a single SDO command (""expedited""), while longer objects require a sequence of interrelated commands (""segmented"").

SDO communication follows a Client/Server model, where the client (usually a higher-level device) sends a request command to the server (the device whose objects are being accessed). The server then responds with a response command, indicating the success or failure of the request. If an error occurs, the server sends an ""SDO abort transfer"" response with a specific error code.

In summary, CANopen provides multiple types of data communication, with SDO being a key example. The availability of these communication types is dependent on the network's operational conditions and the specific authorization and status of the devices involved."

Question:  What is the purpose of SDO in CANopen, and how does it access individual objects in the Object Dictionary?","The purpose of the Service Data Object (SDO) in CANopen is to provide a mechanism for direct access to individual objects within the Object Dictionary (OD). This access can be either read-only or read/write, depending on the permissions set for the specific object and the current operational status of the device.

SDO communication operates using a Client/Server model. In this model, the client, typically a higher-level controller or supervisory system, sends a ""request"" command to the server, which is the device containing the objects to be accessed. The server then processes this request and sends back a ""response"" command indicating whether the access was successful or if an error occurred.

The process of accessing objects via SDO involves several key steps:

1. **Object Addressing**: The object address within the Object Dictionary serves as an indicator of which object is being accessed. This is detailed in chapter 4.5.1.1 Addressing.

2. **Object Authorization**: Whether access is permitted to a particular object is determined by the object's authorization settings and the current operational status of the device. This is covered in chapter 4.5.1.2 Object access types and chapter 4.4.1 Overview network conditions.

3. **Data Type Handling**: The data type of the object controls the SDO communication process. Objects with data types of 32 bits or shorter (e.g., INTEGER32 or REAL32) can be read or written directly using a single SDO command, known as ""expedited"" transfer. For objects with data types longer than 32 bits, a sequence of interrelated commands, known as ""segmented"" transfer, is used.

4. **Command Structure**: The general structure of SDO messages depends on the access type being used. The specific Command Object Identifier (COB-ID) for SDOs corresponds to the ""Predefined Connection Set"" defined in CiA 301 and cannot be altered. The commands include various request and response codes, such as 40h for request and 4Fh, 4Bh, 47h, 43h, and 41h for different types of responses.

5. **Error Handling**: If an error is detected while processing a request command, the server sends an ""SDO abort transfer"" response with a cancel code (error number) in the data field. The command code for this response is always 80h.

In summary, SDOs in CANopen facilitate detailed and controlled access to the objects within a device's Object Dictionary, enabling both reading and writing of data as required by the application. This is achieved through a structured communication protocol that ensures data integrity and error handling."

Question:  How does the data type of an object affect the SDO communication process in CANopen?","In CANopen, the data type of an object significantly influences the SDO (Service Data Object) communication process. The data type determines how the data is transferred between the client and the server. Here are the key points detailing this influence:

1. **Direct Access for 32-bit and Shorter Data Types**:
   - Objects with data types that are 32 bits or shorter, such as INTEGER32 or REAL32, can be read or written directly using a single SDO command. This type of command is referred to as ""expedited"" because it allows for quick and straightforward data transfer without the need for multiple messages.
   - The expedited transfer is efficient for smaller data sizes, ensuring minimal communication overhead and faster access.

2. **Segmented Transfer for Data Types Longer than 32 Bits**:
   - For objects whose data types exceed 32 bits, the communication process becomes more complex. These objects require a ""segmented"" transfer, which involves a sequence of interrelated commands to read or write the data.
   - The segmented transfer breaks down the data into smaller segments, each transferred in a separate message. This method ensures that larger data can be handled correctly but introduces additional communication overhead and complexity.

3. **Client/Server Communication Model**:
   - The SDO communication follows a client/server model where the client initiates a request to access or modify an object, and the server responds with the result of the request.
   - The server, which holds the object data, processes the request and sends back a response indicating success or failure. This model is consistent regardless of the data type but the nature of the commands (expedited or segmented) depends on the data size.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If an error occurs during the processing of an SDO request, the server sends an ""SDO abort transfer"" response. This response includes an error code that indicates the nature of the problem.
   - The error handling mechanism ensures that both the client and server can manage communication issues effectively, providing feedback on why a particular request could not be completed.

5. **COB-ID and Command Structure**:
   - The COB-ID (Communication Object Identifier) for SDOs is predefined and cannot be altered. This identifier is part of the CANopen protocol and ensures that SDO messages are correctly identified and processed.
   - The structure of SDO commands varies based on the type of access (read or write) and whether the transfer is expedited or segmented. The command codes and their directions (request or response) are predefined and must be adhered to for proper communication.

In summary, the data type of an object in CANopen dictates whether the SDO communication will be expedited or segmented. This, in turn, affects the efficiency and complexity of the data transfer process, with smaller data types allowing for quicker, single-command transfers and larger data types requiring a more involved, multi-command approach."

Question:  What is the role of the client and server in the SDO Client/Server access communication type?","In the SDO (Service Data Object) Client/Server access communication type, the roles of the client and server are clearly defined to facilitate the exchange of data between devices in a CANopen network.

1. **Client Role:**
   - The client is typically a higher-level device or a supervisory controller in the network.
   - The primary responsibility of the client is to initiate communication by sending a ""request"" command to the server. This request specifies the action the client intends to perform, such as reading from or writing to a specific object in the Object Dictionary (OD) of the server.
   - The client uses the object address to indicate which object it wants to access, and the type of access (read or write) is determined by the command sent.

2. **Server Role:**
   - The server is the network participant whose objects are being accessed. This is usually the device that contains the data or parameters that need to be read or written.
   - Upon receiving a request from the client, the server processes the request and sends back a ""response"" command. This response indicates whether the requested action was successful or if an error occurred.
   - The server's response includes the result of the requested operation, such as the data read from an object or a confirmation that data has been written successfully. If an error is detected, the server sends an ""SDO abort transfer"" response with an appropriate error code.

The communication process between the client and server follows a request-response model, ensuring that each request from the client is met with a corresponding response from the server. This structured interaction allows for precise control and monitoring of data exchanges within the CANopen network."

The data type of the object (see chapter *4.5.7 EDS Electronic Data Sheet* and *DataType*)

objects in the OD; see chapter *4.5 The Object* **Dictionary.** 
It is possible to have read only and read/write access to the object. During access, the object address serves as an indicator, which object the access should be given to; see chapter 4.5.1.1 Addressing. <chunk_seperator> For the SDO the Client/Server access is used as a communication type, see chapter **4.3.5.3** Request - Response**.

The PDO transfer protocol is implemented according to *Producer-Consumer* **data model.** 

Basically, there are two types of process data which differ from one another with respect to their direction of communication. For CANopen, the direction is always defined from the point of view of the end nodes.

available to other participants in the network. Transmit Process Data O**bject - which** 
means send process data This is how the actual measurement values of a measurement system, for instance, are sent to other network participants as a TPDO.
Question:  What are the two types of process data in CANopen and how do they differ in terms of communication direction?","In CANopen, there are two types of process data: Transmit Process Data Objects (TPDO) and Receive Process Data Objects (RPDO). These types differ primarily in their direction of communication, which is always defined from the perspective of the end nodes.

1. **TPDO (Transmit Process Data Objects)**:
   - **Direction**: TPDOs are generated by the device (end nodes) and made available to other participants in the network.
   - **Function**: They are used to send process data. For example, the actual measurement values of a measurement system are sent to other network participants as TPDOs. Essentially, TPDOs transmit the data from the device to other nodes in the network.

2. **RPDO (Receive Process Data Objects)**:
   - **Direction**: RPDOs are generated by a different participant in the network and sent to the device.
   - **Function**: They are used to receive process data. These data are often nominal values but can also include additional input signals that the receiver can further process. Essentially, RPDOs receive data from other nodes in the network to the device.

In summary, TPDOs are used for sending data from the device to the network, while RPDOs are used for receiving data from the network to the device."

Pdo <chunk_seperator> Process data are the core information in a control system. They identify the nominal and actual values of different participants. 

The PDO transfer protocol is implemented according to *Producer-Consumer* **data model.** 

Basically, there are two types of process data which differ from one another with respect to their direction of communication. For CANopen, the direction is always defined from the point of view of the end nodes. 

 TPDO **Process data which are generated by the device (end nodes) and made** 
available to other participants in the network. Transmit Process Data O**bject - which** 
means send process data This is how the actual measurement values of a measurement system, for instance, are sent to other network participants as a TPDO.
Question:  What is the significance of PDO Mapping in the context of process data transmission?","PDO Mapping is a crucial aspect of process data transmission in control systems, particularly within the CANopen protocol. It plays a significant role in defining and managing how process data is communicated between devices in a network. Here are the key points that highlight the significance of PDO Mapping:

1. **Customization of Data Transmission**:
   - PDO Mapping allows users to configure which process data will be transmitted and in what manner. This customization is essential because it enables the adaptation of the communication process to the specific needs of the application or system.

2. **Preconfiguration by Manufacturers**:
   - Devices often come with a preconfiguration of the transmitted process data set by the manufacturer. This preconfiguration ensures that the device can start operating with a standard set of parameters, facilitating initial setup and integration into the network.

3. **Flexibility and Adaptability**:
   - Users can change the configuration of PDOs to suit their specific requirements. This flexibility means that a device can be reconfigured to send or receive different sets of process data, which may deviate from the standard behavior. This adaptability is crucial for dynamic and evolving systems where process data needs may change over time.

4. **Ensuring Valid Communication**:
   - Without a valid configuration of a PDO, no process data will be sent or received. This ensures that only properly configured and intended data is communicated, preventing errors and miscommunication in the network.

5. **Management of Transmission Parameters**:
   - PDO Mapping involves setting parameters that define how the object is going to be transmitted, whether cyclically or synchronously. This management is vital for ensuring that the data is transmitted in a manner that aligns with the timing and synchronization requirements of the application.

6. **Producer-Consumer Data Model**:
   - The PDO transfer protocol follows the Producer-Consumer data model, where TPDOs (Transmit Process Data Objects) are generated by the device and made available to other participants, and RPDOs (Receive Process Data Objects) are generated by other participants and sent to the device. PDO Mapping is integral to this model as it determines the flow and direction of process data.

7. **Core Information in Control Systems**:
   - Process data are the core information in a control system, representing nominal and actual values of different participants. Effective PDO Mapping ensures that this core information is accurately and efficiently communicated, which is essential for the proper functioning of the control system.

In summary, PDO Mapping is significant because it provides the necessary framework for configuring, managing, and ensuring the accurate transmission of process data within a CANopen network. It offers flexibility, ensures valid communication, and supports the dynamic needs of control systems."

For tasks in automation technology, it is often necessary to perform processes synchronously. If, for instance, the engine power shall be measured, it is also necessary to measure its speed and torque at the same time. The synchronised transmission of the PDO is one solution for this.

There are two main sections on the screen: one is labeled ""Unite de mesure du debit"" (unit of measure of debt) and the other is titled ""Responsable du capteur"" (responsible for the capture). <chunk_seperator> The SYNC processing can be configured via the object ""*Transmission type""* from the""**xPDO** 
communication parameter"" section. Generating a PDO message does not need to be carried out after each SYNC, but can also be defined as a multiple of the SYNC. Via this mechanism, the transmission can be divided into important or informative PDOs. The usual time intervals for SYNC range within a few 10 ms. For example, a rapidly changing pressure value can be transmitted with every SYNC (e.g. every 10 ms), whereas a slowly changing temperature value can be transmitted every 100 SYNC (100 * 10 ms = 1 s). This is a good solution for the regulation of the bus load. 

The message basically just consists of the CAN ID without the data. This type of transmission causes the lowest bus load in order to achieve the synchronisation of the process data. <chunk_seperator> The message basically just consists of the CAN ID without the data.

Question:  What are the two ways of transmitting process data mentioned in the context?","The two ways of transmitting process data mentioned are:

1. **Event-driven transmission**: This method involves an event in the device triggering the transmission. For example, the transmission can be triggered periodically based on a settable and fixed cycle time, or by specific events such as a measured value exceeding a threshold. Devices may also provide additional event types as defined by their device profiles.

2. **Synchronous transmission**: This method involves the device receiving a synchronization (SYNC) message, which triggers the transmission. The SYNC protocol is implemented according to the Master-Device data model and is used to synchronize the transmission of the Process Data Objects (PDOs). The SYNC device starts its internal signal processing upon receiving the SYNC message and generates and sends a PDO immediately after processing the signal. The transmission can be configured to occur after each SYNC or as a multiple of the SYNC, allowing for the regulation of bus load by transmitting important or informative PDOs at different intervals."

Question:  How does the SYNC protocol help in automation technology?","The SYNC protocol plays a crucial role in automation technology by ensuring that processes are performed synchronously, which is essential for tasks that require precise timing and coordination. Here’s a detailed explanation of how the SYNC protocol aids in automation technology:

### Synchronous Process Execution
In automation technology, certain tasks need to be executed simultaneously to ensure accurate and reliable operation. For example, when measuring engine power, it is necessary to measure speed and torque at the same time. The SYNC protocol facilitates this by synchronizing the transmission of Process Data Objects (PDOs).

### Master-Device Data Model
The SYNC protocol is implemented according to the Master-Device data model. This model is used to synchronize the PDO transmission, ensuring that all devices in the network operate in unison. The master device sends out a SYNC message, which acts as a trigger for all connected devices to start their internal signal processing.

### Immediate Signal Processing and Transmission
Upon receiving the SYNC message, the SYNC device begins its internal signal processing. Once the signal is processed, a PDO is immediately generated and sent. This ensures that the data is transmitted at the exact moment it is needed, maintaining the synchronization across all devices.

### Time Frame Monitoring
The SYNC device monitors a specific time frame within which a received PDO message is considered valid. Any messages received after this time frame are discarded. This mechanism ensures that only timely and relevant data is processed, maintaining the integrity and synchronization of the system.

### Configurable Transmission Types
The SYNC processing can be configured via the ""Transmission type"" object from the xPDO communication parameter section. This allows for flexibility in how often PDO messages are generated and sent. For instance, not every SYNC message needs to trigger a PDO transmission; it can be set to transmit after a multiple of SYNC messages. This helps in managing the bus load effectively.

### Efficient Bus Load Management
By allowing the transmission to be divided into important or informative PDOs, the SYNC protocol helps in regulating the bus load. For example, rapidly changing values like pressure can be transmitted with every SYNC (e.g., every 10 ms), while slowly changing values like temperature can be transmitted less frequently (e.g., every 100 SYNCs or 1 second). This selective transmission ensures that the bus is not overloaded with unnecessary data, optimizing the performance of the network.

### Minimal Bus Load for Synchronization
The SYNC message itself is minimal, consisting mainly of the CAN ID without additional data. This type of transmission causes the lowest bus load, making it an efficient method for achieving synchronization of process data.

### Example of SYNC Signal
A standard SYNC signal typically includes a CAN ID and a counter, which helps in maintaining the synchronization across the network. The simplicity of the SYNC message ensures that it can be processed quickly and efficiently by all devices in the network.

In summary, the SYNC protocol is essential in automation technology for ensuring that processes are executed synchronously, maintaining precise timing and coordination across all devices in the network. It provides flexibility in transmission types, efficient bus load management, and minimal bus load for synchronization, making it a vital component in automated systems."

This is a good solution for the regulation of the bus load. 

The message basically just consists of the CAN ID without the data. This type of transmission causes the lowest bus load in order to achieve the synchronisation of the process data. <chunk_seperator> The message basically just consists of the CAN ID without the data.

## 4.6.2.3. Pdo Mapping

The PDO mapping is a complex process in which several areas of the OD work together. <chunk_seperator> In addition to the windows, there are several labels and text descriptions throughout the image. These include ""sync"", ""sync time"", ""sync timer"", and ""sync window"". The presence of these labels suggests that this diagram might be related to a computer synchronization or timing system.) for the synchronisation of the *PDO transmission* **which works on the basis of this data model** 
itself. 

Subsequent to receiving the SYNC message, the SYNC device should start its internal signal processing. After having processed the signal, a PDO will immediately be generated and sent. The SYNC device monitors a time frame within which a received PDO message is valid. Messages received after the time frame has expired will be discarded. <chunk_seperator> Note 1: The item *Core* contains the HY-TTC 500 platform's integral logic components (e.g. internal power supply or Main CPU) and is vital to the ECU's general function. Therefore, its failure rate has to be added to every individual safety function, regardless of the utilized set of functional blocks. Note 2: The item *Transient Core Failures* includes the Main CPU's soft errors. These failures are typically only applicable to metrics calculations based on IEC 61508.
Question:  How can the SYNC processing be configured according to the context?","The SYNC processing can be configured via the object ""Transmission type"" from the xPDO communication parameter section. This configuration allows for the definition of how and when the Process Data Objects (PDOs) are transmitted in relation to the SYNC messages. Specifically, the configuration can determine whether a PDO message is generated and sent after each SYNC message or after a multiple of SYNC messages. This flexibility enables the transmission to be tailored to the importance and frequency of the data being sent, thereby optimizing the bus load.

For instance, rapidly changing data such as pressure values can be configured to be transmitted with every SYNC message (e.g., every 10 milliseconds), while more slowly changing data such as temperature values can be set to transmit every 100 SYNC messages (e.g., every 1 second). This method ensures that critical data is updated frequently, while less critical data is updated less often, thus balancing the load on the communication bus.

The SYNC message itself is a minimalistic CAN message that primarily consists of the CAN ID without additional data, which helps in reducing the bus load while achieving the necessary synchronization of process data. The usual time intervals for SYNC messages range within a few tens of milliseconds, making it suitable for real-time automation tasks where synchronized data acquisition and processing are crucial."

In addition, the measurement system changes its operating status (see chapter **4.4 Network** Management) depending on the setting of the error behaviour. See *. Analogue input error.*

Question:  What is the purpose of the PDO communication parameter and PDO mapping parameter areas in the PDO mapping process?","In the PDO (Process Data Object) mapping process, the PDO communication parameter and PDO mapping parameter areas serve distinct but complementary roles:

1. **PDO Communication Parameter**:
   - **Purpose**: This area defines the conditions under which a PDO is transmitted. It essentially sets the rules for when and how the data should be sent over the network.
   - **Details**: 
     - It includes parameters such as the COB-ID (Communication Object Identifier), which uniquely identifies the PDO on the CAN network.
     - The transmission type, which can specify whether the PDO is event-driven, cyclic, or synchronous.
     - Other parameters like inhibit time and event timer, which control the timing and frequency of PDO transmissions. For example, the inhibit time can prevent the PDO from being sent too frequently, while the event timer can ensure periodic transmission.

2. **PDO Mapping Parameter**:
   - **Purpose**: This area specifies which objects from the Object Dictionary (OD) are included in the PDO. It essentially maps the actual data points that will be transmitted within the PDO.
   - **Details**:
     - It includes the indices and sub-indices of the objects in the OD that are to be mapped to the PDO.
     - Each entry in the PDO mapping parameter defines a specific piece of data (e.g., a sensor reading or a control signal) that will be included in the PDO message.
     - The data type and size of each mapped object are also defined here, ensuring that the receiving device can correctly interpret the data.

In summary, the **PDO communication parameter** area sets the rules for when and how the PDO is transmitted, while the **PDO mapping parameter** area defines the specific data elements that are included in the PDO. Together, they ensure that the right data is sent at the right time, facilitating efficient and accurate communication between devices on the CAN network."

Question:  How is the measurement signal ""statical inclination"" from an inclinometer by HYDAC Filtertechnik GmbH transmitted?","The measurement signal ""statical inclination"" from an inclinometer by HYDAC Filtertechnik GmbH is transmitted via the TPDO1 (Transmit Process Data Object 1). The process involves several steps and parameters defined in the PDO (Process Data Object) communication and mapping parameters.

1. **PDO Communication Parameter**: This defines when the PDO is supposed to be transmitted. For TPDO1, the COB-ID is set to 181h, and the transmission type is event-controlled, which is manufacturer-specific. The inhibit time is set to 0, and the event timer is set to 200 ms.

2. **PDO Mapping Parameter**: This defines which objects from the Object Dictionary (OD) will be copied or read for that particular PDO message. In this case, TPDO1 is mapped with three object references:
   - 6010.0 INTEGER16
   - 6020.0 INTEGER16
   - 5000.0 UNSIGNED8

3. **Process Flow Sequence to Change the PDO Mapping**:
   - Switch the device to ""Pre-Operational"" mode.
   - Declare the PDO as invalid by setting bit 31 of the COB-ID to 1.
   - Deactivate the number of object references used in the PDO by setting the number to 0.
   - Set new object references in the area ""xPDO mapping parameter"".
   - Set the number of object references used in the PDO to a new value.
   - Set the PDO back to valid by setting bit 31 of the COB-ID to 0 or setting the object to 0 to activate the standard behavior.
   - Save the changes permanently on the device.
   - Switch the device to ""Operational"" mode.

By following these steps, the measurement signal ""statical inclination"" is effectively transmitted via TPDO1, ensuring that the data is correctly mapped and transmitted according to the defined parameters."

It depends on the error type and the device configuration of the error behaviour, how the measurement system will react to an occurring error. For process data errors, a corresponding error marker is set in the associated status. See chapter *3.3.3 ""VFL status""*. 

In addition, the measurement system changes its operating status (see chapter **4.4 Network** Management) depending on the setting of the error behaviour. See *. Analogue input error.* 
In the case of general device errors, such as communication or configuration errors, it is possible to configure which operation mode the measurement system should take on if an error occurs via the parameter *Error* **behavior.**

Question:  What steps must be followed to change the PDO mapping of a device?","To change the PDO (Process Data Object) mapping of a device, a strict procedure must be followed to ensure the device does not respond with an error message. Here are the detailed steps:

1. **Switch the Device to ""Pre-Operational"" Mode:**
   - Refer to sections 4.4.1 (Overview network conditions) and 4.4.2 (NMT) for guidance on switching the device to pre-operational mode.

2. **Declare the PDO as Invalid:**
   - Set bit 31 of the COB-ID to 1 to declare the PDO as invalid.
   - For TPDO (Transmit PDO), set TPDO.COB ID Bit 31 to 1, e.g., 1800.1 = C00000180h.
   - For RPDO (Receive PDO), set RPDO.COB ID Bit 31 to 1, e.g., 1400.1 = 800000200h180h.

3. **Deactivate the Number of Object References Used in the PDO:**
   - Set the number of object references used in the PDO to 0.
   - Refer to the object: RPDO. ""Number of mapped objects in PDO"".

4. **Set New Object References in the Area ""xPDO Mapping Parameter"":**
   - Memorize the number of new entries for the next step.
   - Refer to chapters 4.6.2.3 (PDO Mapping), 4.5.4.7 (RPDO mapping parameter), and 4.5.4.9 (TPDO mapping parameter) for detailed instructions.

5. **Set the Number of Object References Used in the PDO to a New Value:**
   - Update the number of object references to reflect the new mapping.

6. **Set PDO Back to Valid:**
   - Set bit 31 of the COB-ID to 0 or set the object to 0 to activate the standard behavior.
   - For TPDO1, the standard behavior is $NODEID+180h.
   - Update TPDO.COB ID and RPDO.COB ID accordingly.

7. **Save Changes Permanently on the Device:**
   - Refer to chapter 4.5.1.3 (Objects serving as functions) and the object ""Save communication parameters"" to save the changes.

8. **Switch the Device to ""Operational"" Mode:**
   - Refer to sections 4.4.1 (Overview network conditions) and 4.4.2 (NMT) to switch the device back to operational mode.

By following these steps, the PDO mapping of the device can be successfully changed without causing errors."

Question:  What is the function of the LSS switch command in the context of device parameterization?","The LSS (Layer Setting Services) switch command plays a crucial role in the context of device parameterization within a CANopen network. Its primary function is to switch the active LSS condition, which is essential for configuring devices. Here’s a detailed explanation of its function:

1. **Activation of LSS Configuration Mode**:
   - The LSS switch command is used to activate the LSS configuration mode on a device. This mode is necessary for parameterizing the device, meaning that it allows the device to be set up or configured with specific settings and parameters.

2. **Exclusive Configuration State**:
   - Only one device within the network can be in the LSS configuration mode at any given time. This exclusivity ensures that there are no conflicts or overlaps in the configuration process, which could lead to errors or misconfigurations.

3. **Parameterization Process**:
   - Once the LSS configuration mode is active, the device can be parameterized using other commands. This includes setting various parameters such as communication settings, node IDs, and other device-specific configurations.

4. **Ensuring Proper Configuration**:
   - The LSS switch command ensures that the device is in the correct state to accept and apply configuration changes. Without switching to the LSS configuration mode, the device would not be able to process these parameterization commands correctly.

In summary, the LSS switch command is essential for enabling the configuration mode on a device, ensuring that it can be properly parameterized. This command ensures that only one device is in this mode at a time, preventing conflicts and ensuring a smooth and accurate configuration process."

## 4.7.2.2. Lss Switch State Selective
Question:  What must be done to save a new Node ID after changing it using the ""Configure Node Id"" command?","To save a new Node ID after changing it using the ""Configure Node Id"" command, the following steps must be taken:

1. **Store Configuration Command**: After setting the new Node ID, the ""*Store configuration*"" command must be executed. This command ensures that the new Node ID is saved in the device's non-volatile memory.

2. **Reset Communication or Reset Node Command**: To activate the new Node ID, the NMT (Network Management) command ""*Reset communication*"" or ""*Reset Node*"" must be issued. This step is necessary because, without resetting the device, the current Node ID will remain active, and the new Node ID will not take effect.

In summary, the process involves first saving the new Node ID with the ""*Store configuration*"" command and then activating it by resetting the device using either the ""*Reset communication*"" or ""*Reset Node*"" command."

Category: Comment ID: 591657 The HY-TTC 500 platform is capable of controlling safety-critical actuators with either PWM high side outputs or a combination of digital high side and low side stages. The following section will outline the considerations that have to be taken into account during system integration.

## 4.3.1 Pwm High Side Stages

Category: Comment ID: 592276 The PWM high side stages (*IO_PWM_00* ... *IO_PWM_35*) provide the necessary diagnostic measures and are usable for safety-critical applications, when adhering to the subsequent requirements. Every PWM high side stage also provides a dedicated current measurement function that can also be utilized for safety-critical functions, if required for a given system. <chunk_seperator> ![132_image_0.png]( The image displays a diagram with multiple layers of information related to data transfer and communication. There are several graphs within the diagram, including one that shows the relationship between data rate and delay time. This graph is accompanied by other diagrams illustrating different aspects of the data transfer process.

In addition to these visuals, there are text descriptions accompanying each layer of information, providing further context and clarity on the subject matter. The combination of graphs and text makes this image a comprehensive representation of the data transfer process.)

voltage. <chunk_seperator> A slightly complex procedure is required to activate a new Baud rate after having changed and stored it. The command ""activate bit timing"" must be processed almost exactly at the same time by all the network participants, in order to switch all participants to the new Baud rate and, thus, avoiding that communication errors may occur. The command is not responded to by the device. Switchover procedure: 
 **The command transmits a waiting delay.** 

 **All the participants have to wait two times for this delay to expire before they can** 
send their information using the new Baud rate. 

 **The first half of the delay serves for de-initialisation of all participants. Within this time** 
range, all the participants should terminate the sending of their messages; ""device reaction time"". 
 **The waiting delay should be chosen in such a way that even the network participant** <chunk_seperator> <table_99>[{'Request  Field': 'Content'}, {'------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------': '------------------------------', '-------------------------------------------------': '-----------'}, {'name  COB ID': '7E5h Tx'}, {'DLC': '8'}, {'BYTE 0': 'Command', 'Command code': 'UNSIGNED8'}, {'BYTE 1': 'Table selector', 'Active baud rate table': 'UNSIGNED8'}, {'0': 'Standard CiA Baud rate table'}, {'BYTE 2': 'Table index', 'Baud rate table index': 'UNSIGNED8'}, {'BYTE 3 - 7': 'Reserved'}]</table_99>
Question:  What is the purpose of the ""activate bit timing"" command in the context of enabling bit timing parameters?","The ""activate bit timing"" command plays a crucial role in the process of switching to a new Baud rate in a network. Its primary purpose is to ensure that all network participants transition to the new Baud rate simultaneously, thereby preventing communication errors that could arise from asynchronous switching. Here is a detailed breakdown of its purpose and functionality:

1. **Synchronized Transition**: The command ensures that all network participants switch to the new Baud rate at almost the same time. This synchronization is vital to maintain communication integrity across the network.

2. **Waiting Delay Transmission**: The command transmits a waiting delay, which is a critical component of the switchover procedure. This delay is used to manage the timing of the transition process.

3. **Two-Phase Waiting Period**:
   - **First Phase (De-initialization)**: During the first half of the waiting delay, all participants are required to terminate the sending of their messages. This phase is known as the ""device reaction time"" and serves to de-initialize all participants, ensuring that no messages are being sent during the transition.
   - **Second Phase (Re-initialization)**: After the first phase, the second half of the waiting delay allows for the re-initialization of all participants. Once this phase expires, participants can start sending messages using the new Baud rate.

4. **Avoiding Communication Errors**: By ensuring that all participants wait for the specified delay before switching to the new Baud rate, the command helps avoid communication errors that could occur if some devices switch earlier or later than others.

5. **No Response from Device**: It is important to note that the ""activate bit timing"" command is not responded to by the device. This means that the command is executed without any acknowledgment, relying solely on the timing mechanism to ensure proper execution.

6. **Example Implementation**: In the provided example, the LSS master defines a delay of 2 seconds (2000 milliseconds or 07D0h) before the participants can start using the new Baud rate. This delay is communicated to all participants to ensure they follow the same timing protocol.

In summary, the ""activate bit timing"" command is essential for coordinating the transition to a new Baud rate across all network participants, ensuring a smooth and error-free switch by utilizing a well-defined waiting delay mechanism."

Category: Comment ID: 723224 An error is classified as being fatal, if a safe program execution is not possible anymore, regardless of the actual application. The following errors are characterized as being fatal:
- errors that are fatal in their consequence, so that an anti-glitch strategy is not feasible (e.g. RAM or register errors, safe state activation by the Safety Companion)
- temporary errors that persist over the anti-glitch time For fatal errors, the HY-TTC 500 platform's failure reaction is to enter the safe state immediately. If the according notification callback is configured, the application software will be notified by the I/O-driver diagnostics.

The following section shows how to store recent changes in the device permanently with the LSS command ""store configuration"".
Question:  What is the purpose of the ""LSS inquire command""?","The ""LSS inquire command"" is used to retrieve specific identity information from devices that are currently in the ""LSS configuration"" mode. This command allows for the inquiry of various sections of the LSS address and the recent node ID of all devices in this mode. The purpose of this command is to gather detailed information about the devices, such as the Vendor-ID, Product-Code, and Revision-Number, which are essential for identifying and managing the devices within a network.

The command operates on a request-response model, where a request is sent to the device, and the device responds with the requested information. The structure of the request and response messages varies depending on the specific identity information being inquired. Here are the specific purposes for each type of inquiry under the LSS inquire command:

1. **Inquire Identity Vendor-ID**: This command retrieves the CiA manufacturer code, which is defined in the OD.Identity Object Vendor-ID (1018.1). The response includes the Vendor-ID, which is a unique identifier for the manufacturer of the device.

2. **Inquire Identity Product-Code**: This command retrieves the manufacturer-specific product code, as defined in the OD.Identity Object Product code (1018.2). The response includes the Product-Code, which identifies the specific product model of the device.

3. **Inquire Identity Revision-Number**: This command retrieves the product revision number, as defined in the OD.Identity Object Revision number (1018.3). The response includes the Revision-Number, which indicates the version or revision of the product.

It is important to note that only one device should be in the ""LSS configuration"" mode at a time to avoid conflicts, as multiple devices responding simultaneously can lead to unpredictable results. The LSS inquire command is crucial for network management, allowing for the identification and configuration of devices within a CANopen network."

Category: Comment ID: 723224 An error is classified as being fatal, if a safe program execution is not possible anymore, regardless of the actual application. The following errors are characterized as being fatal:
- errors that are fatal in their consequence, so that an anti-glitch strategy is not feasible (e.g. RAM or register errors, safe state activation by the Safety Companion)
- temporary errors that persist over the anti-glitch time For fatal errors, the HY-TTC 500 platform's failure reaction is to enter the safe state immediately. If the according notification callback is configured, the application software will be notified by the I/O-driver diagnostics.

The LSS identity commands serve to find out how many devices with LSS protocol support are currently connected to the CAN network. 

## 4.7.5.1. Identify Remote Slave <chunk_seperator> In the protocol described, the first entry of the RECORD defines the highest existing subindex in the existing sections of a record. This entry always has a sub-index of 0 and is handled in a special way. The number of entries may be smaller than this value, as not all of the sub indices need to be used. In a RECORD, a maximum of 255 entries is allowed. The individual value entries are accessed via a sub-index. The first sub-index for a value entry is 1. If a sub-index is accessed which is of higher value than the content of the subindex 0 (number of valid RECORD entries), an error message will occur. The same applies when accessing a ""gap"" in the RECORD (a non-defined sub-index). <chunk_seperator> The timer input IO_PWD_00 to IO_PWD_05 can be alternatively **also used as digital (7/14 mA)** current loop sensor inputs.

1. Option 1**: Use a digital output for supplying the sensor. When the device is switched off, the**
ECU can perform an application-controlled shutdown, e. g., **in order to operate a cooling fan** to cool down an engine until the temperature is low enough or to store data in the non-volatile memory of the ECU.

Category: Comment ID: 592129 If redundant sensors are used for detection of short circuits between sensor lines, external to the ECU, 
sensors with diverse characteristics are recommended in order to continuously monitor the signal lines for external short circuits. The following types of diverse sensors are commonly used:
- Two identical potentiometers with opposite characteristics (i.e. when changing the physical input value, one sensor reacts with an increasing sensor value while the other one reacts with a decreasing sensor value). With a short circuit between those two sensors, the ECU will measure a value of 50 % full range for both sensors. This output value is plausible but wrong. <chunk_seperator> ## 4.7.5.1. Identify Remote Slave

If more devices are connected to the CAN network, the number of devices with LSS protocol support can be determined. For this purpose, the master (control) has to send 6 consecutive messages in total. The messages contain parameters of the *LSS address***. In order to set a** 
limit to the selection of the devices, the manufacturer and product code are firmly defined. The selection is limited using a pre-defined value range for the revision and serial number. If devices exist which correspond with the LSS address section which is pre-defined by the command sequence, these can respond with the ""*Identify slave***"" command.**

Question:  What is the function of the LSS identity commands as described in section 4.7.5?","The LSS identity commands, as described in section 4.7.5, serve to determine how many devices with LSS (Layer Setting Services) protocol support are currently connected to the CAN (Controller Area Network) network. These commands are used to identify and count the devices that support the LSS protocol, which is essential for network configuration and management.

To achieve this, the master (control) device sends a series of six consecutive messages. These messages contain parameters of the LSS address, which include the manufacturer and product code, as well as a pre-defined value range for the revision and serial number. This sequence of messages helps to limit the selection of devices by specifying a range of values that the devices must match.

If there are devices on the network that correspond to the LSS address section defined by the command sequence, these devices will respond with the ""Identify slave"" command. This response indicates that the device supports the LSS protocol and is currently connected to the network.

In summary, the LSS identity commands are used to:
1. Identify the number of devices with LSS protocol support on the CAN network.
2. Limit the selection of devices based on specific parameters such as manufacturer, product code, revision number, and serial number.
3. Enable devices that match the specified criteria to respond, thereby confirming their presence and LSS protocol support on the network."

If the application controlled shut-down is finished, the ECU switches off and consumes less than 1 mA of battery current (including sensors). <chunk_seperator> Object for the device Baud rate; see chapter *4.2.5 Transmission* **speed.**

Category: Comment ID: 592129 If redundant sensors are used for detection of short circuits between sensor lines, external to the ECU, 
sensors with diverse characteristics are recommended in order to continuously monitor the signal lines for external short circuits. The following types of diverse sensors are commonly used:
- Two identical potentiometers with opposite characteristics (i.e. when changing the physical input value, one sensor reacts with an increasing sensor value while the other one reacts with a decreasing sensor value). With a short circuit between those two sensors, the ECU will measure a value of 50 % full range for both sensors. This output value is plausible but wrong. <chunk_seperator> ## 4.7.5.1. Identify Remote Slave

If more devices are connected to the CAN network, the number of devices with LSS protocol support can be determined. For this purpose, the master (control) has to send 6 consecutive messages in total. The messages contain parameters of the *LSS address***. In order to set a** 
limit to the selection of the devices, the manufacturer and product code are firmly defined. The selection is limited using a pre-defined value range for the revision and serial number. If devices exist which correspond with the LSS address section which is pre-defined by the command sequence, these can respond with the ""*Identify slave***"" command.** 
Relationship between the command code and the LSS address section transmission. The individual request commands should be sent to the device in ascending order. <chunk_seperator> This command serves to inquire the device serial number as it is defined in the ""*OD.Identity* Object.Serial number (1018.4)"". The command is implemented according to **Request** 
response model. 

Please observe: Only one device may be in the ""*LSS configuration***"" mode at a time.** 
The commands ""request"" or ""response"" have different structures. The structures of both messages are shown below. <chunk_seperator> 'IO_DO_36'}, {'Pin 163': '73', 'IO_PWM_21': 'IO_DO_37'}, {'Pin 190': '74', 'IO_PWM_22': 'IO_DO_38'}, {'Pin 166': '75', 'IO_PWM_23': 'IO_DO_39'}, {'Pin 193': '76', 'IO_PWM_24': 'IO_DO_40'}, {'Pin 169': '77', 'IO_PWM_25': 'IO_DO_41'}, {'Pin 196': '78', 'IO_PWM_26': 'IO_DO_42'}, {'Pin 172': '79', 'IO_PWM_27': 'IO_DO_43'}, {'Pin 101': '80', 'IO_PWM_28': 'IO_DO_44', 'IO_DI_28': 'IO_PWD_12'}, {'Pin 125': '81', 'IO_PWM_29': 'IO_DO_45', 'IO_DI_29': 'IO_PWD_13'}, {'Pin 150': '82', 'IO_PWM_30': 'IO_DO_46', 'IO_DI_30': 'IO_PWD_14'}, {'Pin 174': '83', 'IO_PWM_31': 'IO_DO_47', 'IO_DI_31': 'IO_PWD_15'}, {'Pin 102': '84', 'IO_PWM_32': 'IO_DO_48', 'IO_DI_32': 'IO_PWD_16'}]</table_129>

The nominal supply voltage for full operation is between 6 and 32 V, including supply voltage ranges for 12 and 24 V battery operation. In this voltage range, all the I/Os work, as described in the system manual. BAT+ Power pins are equipped with inverse polarity protection. <chunk_seperator> The following example shows how a LSS master switches one particular device to the ""*LSSConfiguration*"" state via the ""*global switch*"" command. Subsequently, a new *Node ID* **(2)** 
and *Baud rate* **(250 kbit/s) will be defined. These will be stored permanently on the device** 
and finally, the device will be restarted with the new setttings. <chunk_seperator> ## Outputs

## Specifications <chunk_seperator> With the fastscan protocol, a LSS master can identify the *LSS address* **of unknown and nonconfigured devices. In the beginning of such a requests, all non-configured devices have to** 
be in the ""*LSS Waiting***"" mode.** 
The inquiry will be initiated by the LSS master by a particular request (""Bit Check"" = 128) in order to mark the start of the request sequence. This inquiry should be confirmed by all LSS 
devices which have not yet been configured by response ""*Identify slave***"". By means of this** 
response, the LSS master recognises that further LSS devices need to be configured. That is to say, the fastscan protocol performs a search for existing LSS addresses. For this purpose, all sections of the *LSS address* **are inquired bit by bit and sequentially. LSS devices** 
with matching address sections confirm the related request positively by sending the response ""*Identify slave""***. If the recently inquired address section does not match, no** <chunk_seperator> In the other section, there are several tables with rows of textual data, likely providing additional context or details about the subject matter. The tables occupy most of the right side of the screen. Overall, this image presents a combination of visual and text-based information to convey its message effectively.)

 This symbol enables access to the measured values of channel settings. Tapping this symbol expands the function bar at the left of the screen, where short explanatory notes describe the function of each symbol. <chunk_seperator> Note 1: The item *Core* contains the HY-TTC 500 platform's integral logic components (e.g. internal power supply or Main CPU) and is vital to the ECU's general function. Therefore, its failure rate has to be added to every individual safety function, regardless of the utilized set of functional blocks. Note 2: The item *Transient Core Failures* includes the Main CPU's soft errors. These failures are typically only applicable to metrics calculations based on IEC 61508. <chunk_seperator> The HMG 4000's ""measured values"" feature enables data ranges from a PDO to be visualised as a measured value. For this purpose, the channels ""CAN-Bus/HCSI (K)"" are available in the settings for the measured values. In below example, the process data ""signal static inclination"" and ""signal acceleration"" are shown from an inclination sensor by HYDAC Electronic GmbH. The settings required for the measurement of the ""signal static inclination (K1 slope long)"" is explained more in detail.

Question:  How does the LSS master initiate the inquiry for identifying unknown LSS addresses?","The LSS master initiates the inquiry for identifying unknown LSS addresses by sending a specific request with the ""Bit Check"" value set to 128. This request marks the start of the inquiry sequence. At the beginning of this process, all non-configured devices must be in the ""LSS Waiting"" mode. 

Upon receiving this request, all non-configured LSS devices respond with an ""Identify slave"" message, indicating to the LSS master that there are devices that need to be configured. The LSS master then proceeds to search for existing LSS addresses by inquiring each section of the LSS address bit by bit and sequentially.

During this process, LSS devices with matching address sections confirm the request by sending the ""Identify slave"" response. If a device's address section does not match the inquiry, it does not send a response. The LSS master waits for a defined time, corrects the address section it has received, and then requests the next address section. This bit-by-bit inquiry can require up to 132 single requests (4 * 32 bits + 4) to fully detect the LSS address of a particular device.

Once a device has been clearly identified, it automatically switches to the ""LSS configuration"" state and confirms the successful identification by sending another ""Identify slave"" response. The LSS master can then configure the device using the LSS features."

## 4.7.7. Example: Setting The Node Id And Baud Rate Via Lss <chunk_seperator> with matching address sections confirm the related request positively by sending the response ""*Identify slave""***. If the recently inquired address section does not match, no** 
response will be sent by the LSS device. In this case, the LSS master waits for a defined time, corrects the address section it has already received and requests the next address section. Therefore, up to 132 (4 * 32bit **+ 4) single requests are required in order to detect** 
the LSS address of a certain LSS device. <chunk_seperator> If a LSS device has been clearly identified, it will automatically switch to the ""*LSS configuration*"" state after the sequence has expired and confirm that the process has been successful by ""*Identify slave""***. The LSS device can now be condigured by the LSS master accordingly by means of the LSS features described above.**

## 12.2.3 Gérer Les Enregistrements

Cette option permet de gérer les enregistrements enregistrés sur le capteur CM. 

Les enregistrements peuvent être importés, affichés et modifiés sur l'HMG 4000 (voir le chap. 8 
« Enregistrements »). 

Le bouton permet d'accéder à la fenêtre *« Réglages »*. 

Vous pouvez modifier ici les spécifications pour l'importation des enregistrements. 

## 12.2.4 Réglages 

![99_image_1.Png](99_image_1.Png)

Ce menu varie selon le capteur CM raccordé. 

Les réglages possibles, préréglages, etc. 

sont disponibles dans le manuel du capteur CM employé. <chunk_seperator> <table_97>[{'P201': 'Battery (+) Supply of Power Stages / BAT+ Power'}, {'--------': '---------------------------------------------------'}, {'P202': 'Battery (+) Supply of Power Stages / BAT+ Power'}, {'P203': 'Battery (+) Supply of Power Stages / BAT+ Power'}, {'P204': 'Battery (+) Supply of Power Stages / BAT+ Power'}, {'P205': 'Battery (+) Supply of Power Stages / BAT+ Power'}, {'P206': 'Battery (+) Supply of Power Stages / BAT+ Power'}]</table_97>
Supply pins for power stage supply.

The nominal supply voltage for full operation is between 6 and 32 V, including supply voltage ranges for 12 and 24 V battery operation. In this voltage range, all the I/Os work, as described in the system manual. BAT+ Power pins are equipped with inverse polarity protection. <chunk_seperator> The following example shows how a LSS master switches one particular device to the ""*LSSConfiguration*"" state via the ""*global switch*"" command. Subsequently, a new *Node ID* **(2)** 
and *Baud rate* **(250 kbit/s) will be defined. These will be stored permanently on the device** 
and finally, the device will be restarted with the new setttings. <chunk_seperator> ## Outputs

## Specifications <chunk_seperator> With the fastscan protocol, a LSS master can identify the *LSS address* **of unknown and nonconfigured devices. In the beginning of such a requests, all non-configured devices have to** 
be in the ""*LSS Waiting***"" mode.** 
The inquiry will be initiated by the LSS master by a particular request (""Bit Check"" = 128) in order to mark the start of the request sequence. This inquiry should be confirmed by all LSS 
devices which have not yet been configured by response ""*Identify slave***"". By means of this** 
response, the LSS master recognises that further LSS devices need to be configured. That is to say, the fastscan protocol performs a search for existing LSS addresses. For this purpose, all sections of the *LSS address* **are inquired bit by bit and sequentially. LSS devices** 
with matching address sections confirm the related request positively by sending the response ""*Identify slave""***. If the recently inquired address section does not match, no** <chunk_seperator> In the other section, there are several tables with rows of textual data, likely providing additional context or details about the subject matter. The tables occupy most of the right side of the screen. Overall, this image presents a combination of visual and text-based information to convey its message effectively.)

 This symbol enables access to the measured values of channel settings. Tapping this symbol expands the function bar at the left of the screen, where short explanatory notes describe the function of each symbol. <chunk_seperator> Note 1: The item *Core* contains the HY-TTC 500 platform's integral logic components (e.g. internal power supply or Main CPU) and is vital to the ECU's general function. Therefore, its failure rate has to be added to every individual safety function, regardless of the utilized set of functional blocks. Note 2: The item *Transient Core Failures* includes the Main CPU's soft errors. These failures are typically only applicable to metrics calculations based on IEC 61508. <chunk_seperator> The HMG 4000's ""measured values"" feature enables data ranges from a PDO to be visualised as a measured value. For this purpose, the channels ""CAN-Bus/HCSI (K)"" are available in the settings for the measured values. In below example, the process data ""signal static inclination"" and ""signal acceleration"" are shown from an inclination sensor by HYDAC Electronic GmbH. The settings required for the measurement of the ""signal static inclination (K1 slope long)"" is explained more in detail. 

![148_image_0.png]( The image displays a computer screen with two different sections showing various data and information. In one section, there is a graph displaying a line of numbers that appears to be related to weight or measurements. This part of the screen has a focus on the left side. <chunk_seperator> CAN-ID (hex) <table_122>[{'Direction: Tx (ECU → Device); Rx (Device → ECU)': 'Data Length', 'Data Bytes (hex)': '+--- +- + +- -- -- -- -- -- -- --'}, {'Farbe': 'Pin 2', 'Pin 4': 'Pin 5'}, {'----------': '----------', '---------': '---------', '------': '------'}, {'Buchse': 'Kanal', 'Pin 1': 'Pin 3'}, {'A ...

## 5.1.2. Pdo Process Values As Measurements
Question:  What happens to an LSS device after it has been clearly identified and the sequence has expired?","After an LSS device has been clearly identified and the sequence has expired, it will automatically switch to the ""LSS configuration"" state. The device will then confirm that the identification process has been successful by sending the response ""Identify slave."" Once in the ""LSS configuration"" state, the LSS device can be configured by the LSS master using the LSS features. This configuration process allows the LSS master to set parameters such as the Node ID and Baud rate for the device."

Question:  How is the measurement range and scaling of the process value described in the channel characteristics?","The measurement range and scaling of the process value in the channel characteristics are described through several key parameters:

1. **Measurement Range**: This feature is used to define the value range and scaling of the process value to be displayed. It includes the following details:
   - **Number of Decimal Places**: Specifies how many decimal places the displayed value should have.
   - **Maximum and Minimum Values**: Defines the upper and lower limits of the measurement range.
   - **Physical Unit**: Indicates the unit of measurement for the process value (e.g., degrees, meters, etc.).

   This information can be found in the menu process data in the product description, specifically in chapter 3.3 Process Data and 4.5.4.9 TPDO Mapping Parameter.

2. **Resolution**: The resolution defines the value of a single bit of the digital value transmitted with the PDO. It includes the ""increment"" of the scaled process value. The formula used is:
   - **Process Value** = (Digital Value * Resolution) - Offset

   For example, if the resolution is 0.01 °/bit:
   - 0001h = 0.01°
   - 0005h = 0.05°
   - 04B0h = 12.00°

   The resolution and offset information can also be found in the menu process data in the product description, in the same chapters mentioned above.

3. **Offset**: This is the zero offset of the process value, which is used in conjunction with the resolution to calculate the actual process value.

These parameters collectively describe how the measurement range and scaling of the process value are managed within the channel characteristics, ensuring accurate representation and interpretation of the data."

Question:  How is the CAN ID of the PDO message represented and what must it correspond with?","The CAN ID of the PDO (Process Data Object) message is represented as a hexadecimal value.

Each measurement channel of the HMG 4000 operates independently, so the CAN ID must be predetermined in the same way as the message will be transmitted. Automatic calculation via the Node ID is not possible. 

For example, the CAN ID for TPDO1 (Transmit PDO 1) might be represented as `1800.1 $NODEID+40000180h`. If the active Node ID is 5, the measured value COB-ID would be `185h`. This ensures that the CAN ID aligns correctly with the specific PDO message being processed."

## 6.10 Io_Lin_Data_Frame_ Struct Reference

LIN data frame. <chunk_seperator> The HMG 4000 offers suitable features for many of the characteristics described in this protocol description. 

The most important features are briefly explained in the following chapters. 

![152_image_0.png]( The image displays a computer screen with several different sections and menus. There are multiple icons and text displayed on the screen, indicating that it is likely an interface for managing or accessing various programs or services.

In one section of the screen, there is a list of options labeled ""Disk Manager."" A green box is highlighted in this area, possibly indicating a specific action to be taken or a relevant item within the list. The overall layout and content of the screen suggest that it could be part of a computer's control panel or a software application for managing storage or system settings.)

## 5.1.3.1. Wizard
Question:  What does the bit position define within the data range of a CAN message?","The bit position defines the location of the digital value's first bit within the data range of a CAN message. Specifically, it indicates where the first bit of the process value is situated in the CAN message's data range. The counting method for determining the bit position starts at 0, meaning that the first bit within the CAN message's data range is assigned the bit position 0. This is crucial for the correct mapping and interpretation of the process data within the CAN protocol."

Note**: If the node ID or the Baud rate are changed directly in the EDS window, the function** 
""*Save LSS parameters*"" also has to be changed via the EDS window, as described in chapter *4.5.4.3 Storage and restoring (general communication objects).*
 The PDO wizard is a special feature. With this function, the *PDO Mapping* **can be** 
configured very easily. The PDO wizard leads you through all the objects of the 
""*communication*"" and ""*mapping parameter*"" step by step. 

 The SRDO wizard is another special feature. This special wizard helps you carry out the more complicated configurations of safety-relevant process values. Whether such values are supported by this device used is described in chapter *3.4 Functionally safe process* data. <chunk_seperator> ![153_image_1.png](1.

There are no distinct features or details within the scene, making it a simple and minimalistic representation of an empty space.) <chunk_seperator> ## 5.1.3.1. Wizard

The ""wizard"" offers the ability to change the most important CANopen settings, such as *Baud* rate and *Node ID*, without detailed knowledge of the device. The wizard uses *LSS Protocol* for that purpose. Using this universal protocol, all devices supporting LSS can be recognised and configured. 

![152_image_1.png]( The image displays two screens of a computer application that appears to be related to a booking system or an online booking platform. On one screen, there is a list of available books with their respective prices and descriptions. In the other screen, there are multiple tables displaying information about the books, such as their titles, authors, and categories.

The tables on the second screen have various columns that provide more details about each book. The layout of these screens allows users to easily navigate through the available options and make informed decisions when selecting a book for purchase or rental.) <chunk_seperator> In addition to the main content displayed within these windows, there are several other elements present in the image.

While using this function, several devices may be connected at the same time. This is why it is inevitable to preselect the *Node ID* **(node ID) of the device you wish to use before importing any data.** 
The suitable file for the device used can now be selected from a list of EDS files available on the HMG 4000. The files often contain the manufacturer's part number as an identifier in the file name. In a first step, available files have to be copied into the ""file manager"" in the HMG 4000 directory ""CanTools\Eds\General"". After ""open"", all the objects will be loaded from the OD and visualised as a list. <chunk_seperator> ![91_image_0.png]( The image displays a table with various columns of numbers and text. There are multiple rows of data, including some that have the word ""million"" written on them. The table appears to be organized into different sections or categories, each containing numerical information. <chunk_seperator> ## Data Structures

The first window is focused on a list of names and dates, while the second window appears to be related to data or information. There are multiple people's names visible in the first window, along with some dates.
Question:  What settings can be changed using the wizard in the CANopen system?","The wizard in the CANopen system allows users to change several key settings without requiring detailed knowledge of the device. These settings include:

1. **Baud Rate**: The speed at which data is transmitted over the CANopen network can be adjusted.
2. **Node ID**: The unique identifier for each device on the CANopen network can be modified.

The wizard utilizes the LSS (Layer Setting Services) Protocol to recognize and configure all devices that support LSS. This ensures that the settings can be changed universally across different devices.

Additionally, the wizard provides the capability to import and modify objects from the device's Object Dictionary (OD) using the Electronic Data Sheet (EDS) function. This includes:
- Changing object entries.
- Importing EDS files, which often contain the manufacturer's part number as an identifier.
- Visualizing and modifying objects from the OD.

To store changes permanently on the device, the ""memory"" function must be used, which performs the ""Save all parameters"" operation. If the node ID or Baud rate is changed directly in the EDS window, the ""Save LSS parameters"" function must also be used to ensure these changes are stored correctly.

The wizard also includes special features such as:
- **PDO Wizard**: This feature simplifies the configuration of PDO (Process Data Object) Mapping by guiding the user through the communication and mapping parameters step by step.
- **SRDO Wizard**: This feature assists in configuring safety-relevant process values, which are more complex. The support for such values is detailed in the device's documentation.

These functionalities make the wizard a powerful tool for configuring and managing CANopen devices efficiently."

Question:  How can the HMG 4000 simulate the tasks of a CANopen Master?","The HMG 4000 can simulate the tasks of a CANopen Master through its Network Management (NMT) functions. These functions allow the HMG 4000 to provide the most important NMT messages, which are essential for managing the network. Specifically, the HMG 4000 can change the NMT status of the connected network participants, effectively simulating the control and coordination typically handled by a CANopen Master.

The NMT messages are crucial for the initialization, configuration, and monitoring of the network. By sending these messages, the HMG 4000 can perform tasks such as starting and stopping nodes, resetting nodes, and setting nodes to pre-operational or operational states. This capability allows the HMG 4000 to manage the network participants and ensure proper communication and functionality within the CAN network.

In summary, the HMG 4000 simulates the tasks of a CANopen Master by using its Network Management functions to send NMT messages that control and manage the status of the network participants."

Question:  What is the purpose of the PCAN-View program by PEAK-System Technik GmbH?","The PCAN-View program by PEAK-System Technik GmbH is a widely used PC-based application designed for the visualization, sending, and receiving of CAN (Controller Area Network) messages. Its primary purpose is to facilitate the interaction with CAN networks by providing a user-friendly interface for monitoring and managing CAN communications. Here are the key functionalities and purposes of the PCAN-View program:

1. **Visualization of CAN Messages**: The program allows users to view all the messages currently waiting at the CAN. These messages are visualized and can be grouped according to their CAN ID, making it easier to manage and interpret the data.

2. **Chronological Protocols**: The ""Trace"" menu function offers a chronological protocol of the messages. This feature is useful for tracking the sequence of events and understanding the flow of communication within the CAN network. These protocols can also be stored in files for later analysis.

3. **Sending CAN Messages**: PCAN-View provides the capability to send CAN messages. Users can generate multiple messages that can be sent either spontaneously or periodically. This is particularly useful for testing and simulating various scenarios within the CAN network.

4. **Definition of CAN Messages**: The program allows for the definition of specific CAN messages, such as the ""SDO expedited Download"" command. This feature enables users to perform tasks like changing the node ID or Baud rate of a device and storing these changes permanently.

5. **Periodic Message Sending**: For tasks that require periodic communication, such as simulating a SYNC Master, the program allows users to assign a cycle time to messages, ensuring they are sent at regular intervals.

Overall, PCAN-View is a comprehensive tool for anyone working with CAN networks, providing essential features for monitoring, managing, and simulating CAN communications effectively."

## 5 Function

HYDACLAB® is a compact, multi-functional sensor for determining the online condition of oil. The user is kept informed of changes in fluid condition as they occur and can take immediate action in the case of deteriorating operating conditions. Changes in fluid condition that might occur due to ageing or mixing with other fluids, for example, are indicated by measuring the temperature, the saturation level, the relative change in electrical conductivity and the relative change in dielectric constant (also referred to as DC). <chunk_seperator> ## 5.1.3.3.

Question:  What is required to create a periodically sent CAN message to simulate an SYNC Master?","To create a periodically sent CAN message to simulate a SYNC Master, it is necessary to assign a cycle time greater than 0 milliseconds to the message. This cycle time ensures that the message is sent at regular intervals, which is essential for the synchronization process in a CAN network. The periodic transmission of the SYNC message allows all nodes in the network to synchronize their actions based on the timing provided by the SYNC Master."

## 3.1.5.2.1 Pwm High Side Outputs

Category: Comment ID: 813082 Due to the PWM signal's nature, the configured PWM frequency is directly related to the worst case failure reaction time. The effective increase of the core's failure reaction time is twice the PWM output period plus an additional application cycle.

wc_frt_io = 2 * pwm_period + t_cycle Category: Comment ID: 813449 In case the PWM high side current measurement is considered safety-relevant, the effective increase of the core's failure reaction time is 20 ms plus an additional application cycle.

wc_frt_io = 20 *ms + t_cycle*

The appendix provides useful additional information. 

## 7.1. Ascii Table

Below is a list of the portrayable characters of the ASCII character set. By summing the horizontal and vertical identification code, the numeric value belonging to the particular character can be determined. The ASCII character encoding forms the basis of most of the character sets used for a standardised representation of the most important characters. 

Particular language-specific special characters, such as the ß **which is part of the German** 
written language, cannot be displayed using ASCII encoding. For the representation of these characters, there are special international character sets which will not be referred to herein, as special characters are not supported by the devices. 

## Examples <chunk_seperator> ## 19.1.2 Entrées Numériques <chunk_seperator> In order to create a periodically sent CAN message, as is necessary, for instance to simulate an SYNC Master, a cycle time of > 0 ms has to be assigned to the message.

![157_image_1.png]( The image displays a computer screen with various options and settings for a video editing program. There are multiple buttons on the screen, including one that reads ""Send Botschafter beerdet."" A remote control is also visible within the scene. Additionally, there is a keyboard in the lower left corner of the screen.

The computer screen has a mix of German and English text, indicating that it might be used by someone who speaks both languages or is working with international content.)

## 7. Appendix

The appendix provides useful additional information. 

## 7.1. Ascii Table
Question:  What does the ASCII table in the appendix provide information about?","The ASCII table in the appendix provides detailed information about the portrayable characters of the ASCII character set. It explains how to determine the numeric value associated with each character by summing the horizontal and vertical identification codes. The table includes both the decimal (d) and hexadecimal (h) values for each character.

The appendix also highlights that the ASCII character encoding forms the basis for most standardized character sets used for representing important characters. However, it notes that certain language-specific special characters, such as the German ""ß,"" cannot be displayed using ASCII encoding. For these characters, special international character sets are required, which are not supported by the devices discussed in the manual.

The table itself is structured to show the control characters, punctuation marks, numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and other symbols, along with their corresponding ASCII values. For example, it provides the numeric value for a blank space (32d or 20h) and for the capital letter ""A"" (65d or 41h). This information is crucial for understanding how characters are encoded and represented in digital systems."
