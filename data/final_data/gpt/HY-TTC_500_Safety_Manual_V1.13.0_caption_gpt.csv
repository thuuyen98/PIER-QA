## 7.7.2 Digital Output Protection

Each digital output is individually protected against overcurrent. Whenever a fatal overcurrent situation is detected on any safe or unsafe digital output, the output is disabled by software. Note that disabled by software means that the output is set to low but the state of the safety switch (if configured) remains unchanged.

When entering the protection state, the digital output has to remain in this state for the given wait time. After this wait time the digital output can be reenabled via function **IO_DO_ResetProtection()**. Note that the number of reenabling operations for a single digital output is limited to 10. Refer to function IO_DO_ResetProtection() for more information on how to reenable a digital output.

Detailed information about fatal overcurrent situations, **the reaction time and wait time are listed in** the following table. <chunk_seperator> une liste de sélection de divers signaux analogiques. Elle permet de sélectionner un signal analogique à partir des entrées existantes.

## 7.7.2 Digital Output Protection

Each digital output is individually protected against overcurrent. Whenever a fatal overcurrent situation is detected on any safe or unsafe digital output, the output is disabled by software. Note that disabled by software means that the output is set to low but the state of the safety switch (if configured) remains unchanged.

When entering the protection state, the digital output has to remain in this state for the given wait time. After this wait time the digital output can be reenabled via function **IO_DO_ResetProtection()**. Note that the number of reenabling operations for a single digital output is limited to 10. Refer to function IO_DO_ResetProtection() for more information on how to reenable a digital output.

## 7.7.2 Digital Output Protection

Each digital output is individually protected against overcurrent. Whenever a fatal overcurrent situation is detected on any safe or unsafe digital output, the output is disabled by software. Note that disabled by software means that the output is set to low but the state of the safety switch (if configured) remains unchanged.

When entering the protection state, the digital output has to remain in this state for the given wait time. After this wait time the digital output can be reenabled via function **IO_DO_ResetProtection()**. Note that the number of reenabling operations for a single digital output is limited to 10. Refer to function IO_DO_ResetProtection() for more information on how to reenable a digital output.

Detailed information about fatal overcurrent situations, **the reaction time and wait time are listed in** the following table. <chunk_seperator> une liste de sélection de divers signaux analogiques. Elle permet de sélectionner un signal analogique à partir des entrées existantes.

Question:  What information is provided in the section on Hardware Metrics Determination?","The section on Hardware Metrics Determination provides detailed information on the following topics:

1. **MTTFd Values of Functional Blocks**: This subsection likely discusses the Mean Time To Dangerous Failure (MTTFd) values for various functional blocks within the system. MTTFd is a key metric in assessing the reliability and safety of hardware components.

2. **Hardware Metrics for Specific Models**: This includes detailed hardware metrics for different models, such as:
   - HY-TTC 508
   - HY-TTC 510
   - HY-TTC 520
   - HY-TTC 580
   - HY-TTC 590/HY-TTC 590E

   Each of these subsections would provide specific metrics and possibly performance data for the respective models, helping users understand the reliability and safety characteristics of each hardware component.

3. **Failure Diagnostics**: This subsection would cover methods and procedures for diagnosing failures within the hardware. It is crucial for maintaining system integrity and ensuring that any issues are promptly identified and addressed.

4. **Combined Safety Mechanisms**: This part likely discusses the integration of various safety mechanisms to enhance overall system safety. It may include strategies for combining different safety features to provide a more robust and fail-safe system.

These sections collectively provide a comprehensive overview of the hardware metrics, focusing on reliability, safety, and diagnostic procedures, which are essential for ensuring the safe operation of the system."

Question:  What types of sensors are covered in the Analog Sensors and Digital Sensors sections?","The document covers various types of sensors in the Analog Sensors and Digital Sensors sections. 

### Analog Sensors
1. **Usage of Redundant Sensors**: This section likely discusses the implementation and benefits of using redundant sensors to enhance reliability and safety.
2. **Potentiometric Analog Sensors**: This section focuses on potentiometric sensors, which are used to measure position or displacement by converting mechanical movement into a change in resistance.

### Digital Sensors
1. **PWM Position Sensors**: This section covers Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) position sensors, which are used to determine the position of an object by measuring the duration of a pulse signal.
2. **RPM Sensors**: This section discusses sensors used to measure the rotational speed (Revolutions Per Minute) of an object.
3. **Digital Switches**: This section likely covers various types of digital switches used for detecting the presence or absence of an object or for other binary state detections.

These sections provide detailed information on the types of sensors, their applications, and possibly their integration into safety-critical systems."

Question:  What components make up the HY-TTC 500 platform?","The HY-TTC 500 platform is composed of several key components designed to ensure its functionality in safety-critical environments. These components include:

1. **HY-TTC 500 Hardware Platform**: This is the physical hardware that forms the basis of the ECU (Electronic Control Unit). It includes all the necessary circuitry and components required for the ECU to function.

2. **Bootloader**: This contains the start-up code for the Main CPU. The bootloader is responsible for initializing the system and preparing it for operation by loading the necessary software components.

3. **Diagnostic Software**: Executed by the Main CPU, this software is crucial for monitoring the health and status of the system. It performs various diagnostic checks to ensure that the system is operating correctly and safely.

4. **I/O Drivers**: These drivers are used for reading sensor data and controlling actuators. They provide the necessary interface between the HY-TTC 500 hardware and the external sensors and actuators, allowing the system to interact with its environment.

These components work together to provide a robust and reliable platform suitable for use in safety-critical applications, ensuring that the system can perform its intended functions while maintaining a high level of safety integrity."

This document frequently refers to the ""system integrator"". The system integrator is the person who is responsible for the integration of the HY-TTC 500 into a safety-related system. The system integrator is responsible for the integration of the HY-TTC 500 into the overall functional safety concept of the integrated system. This means that the requirements described by this document have to be fulfilled by the system integrator to reach the specified level of safety integrity.
Question:  What typographic conventions are used in the Safety Manual to express requirements and additional nonbinding information?","The Safety Manual employs specific typographic conventions to distinguish between requirements and additional nonbinding information:

1. **Requirements**: Attributes that must be fulfilled by the system and/or the application software are expressed as requirements and are shaded in red. This visual distinction emphasizes the mandatory nature of these attributes.

2. **Additional Nonbinding Information**: Information that provides additional context or clarification on the requirements, but is not mandatory, is expressed as *Comment*. This typographic convention helps to differentiate between essential requirements and supplementary information that may aid in understanding or implementing the requirements."

## 2 Safety Lifecycle - - -

Category: Comment ID: 586714 Due to the HY-TTC 500 platform's nature of being a generic control unit for diverse safety-critical applications, the execution of the IEC 61508, ISO 13849 and ISO 25119 safety lifecycle phases are based on specific assumptions for the overall system. These assumptions are listed within the following document and need to be considered by the system integrator. <chunk_seperator> ![63_image_0.png]( The image features a black and white table with various columns of text arranged vertically. The first column is titled ""Alphabet,"" while the second column is labeled ""Abbreviation."" The remaining columns are filled with different words or phrases that appear to be related to the content in the table. <chunk_seperator> For the documentation of the I/O drivers, including information on how to use these drivers in safety related applications, refer to the HY-TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM], Part II: Software Description. Check the release notes for known issues and their impact on the ECU's functions.

The HY-TTC 500 platform cannot guarantee safe operation of the system as a whole. Therefore, certain requirements and constraints have to be fulfilled by the application software as described in this document. Also, a functional safety assessment has to be conducted for the final system according to the system's applicable standards and norms.

Category: Comment ID: 586702 The HY-TTC 500 platform fulfills the requirements of the following safety standards and their assigned safety/performance levels:
- ISO 13849 Category 2, Performance Level d. - IEC 61508 Safety Integrity Level 2.

- ISO 25119 AgPL d/SRL 2.

- <chunk_seperator> - ISO 25119 AgPL d/SRL 2.

The HY-TTC 500 platform may also fulfill the requirements of the ISO 26262 series of standards, however this Safety Manual alone does NOT cover all necessary requirements to use the platform in an ISO 26262 related environment. If the platform will be used in an ISO 26262 related environment the customer needs to fulfil the requirements in this Safety Manual and the ISO 26262 Safety Manual 
[TTC500-SM-26262] addon.

Category: Comment ID: 4572941 The HY-TTC 500 platform allows the system integrator to realize mixed criticality applications (applications containing safe and unsafe code).

Therefore, mechanisms for temporal and spatial separation have been considered during development. Temporal separation is already ensured by design, but spatial separation needs to be implemented by the application software (see section '*Memory Protection Unit*'). <chunk_seperator> Category: Comment ID: 3074044 The following subsections list the corresponding safety lifecycle phases and/or activities partly (e.g. 

overall system phases only applied on ECU level, ...) or completely considered in the course of the HYTTC 500 platform development. Caused by the platforms nature, only a subset of phases/activities have been applied to the HY-TTC 500 which means all other lifecycle phases/activities have to be considered in the course of the system development by the system integrator. Although a phase/activity has already been considered on HY-TTC 500 ECU level, it does not mean that it is not also relevant for the system integrator on system level.

Question:  What must the system integrator implement when realizing mixed criticality applications on the HY-TTC 500 platform?","When realizing mixed criticality applications on the HY-TTC 500 platform, the system integrator must implement the following:

1. **Memory Protection Unit (MPU)**: The system integrator **shall** use the Memory Protection Unit (MPU) to ensure spatial separation of safe and unsafe code. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity and safety of the application, as temporal separation is already ensured by design, but spatial separation needs to be implemented by the application software.

2. **Compliance with Safety Standards**: The system integrator must consider the requirements outlined in the ISO 26262 Safety Manual addon [TTC500-SM-26262] if compliance with ISO 26262 is required. This is essential for ensuring that the platform meets the necessary safety standards for automotive applications.

3. **Functional Safety Assessment**: A functional safety assessment must be conducted for the final system according to the applicable standards and norms. This assessment is necessary to verify that the system as a whole can operate safely, given that the HY-TTC 500 platform alone cannot guarantee safe operation.

4. **Consideration of Assumptions and Lifecycle Phases**: The system integrator must evaluate the assumptions made during the execution of the IEC 61508, ISO 13849, and ISO 25119 safety lifecycle phases. Although some phases/activities have been considered at the ECU level during the development of the HY-TTC 500 platform, the system integrator must ensure that all relevant lifecycle phases/activities are addressed during the system development.

By implementing these measures, the system integrator can effectively manage mixed criticality applications on the HY-TTC 500 platform, ensuring both safety and functionality."

Question:  What must the system integrator verify to achieve safety integrity level 2 (SIL 2) and performance level d (PL d) with the HY-TTC 500 platform?","To achieve safety integrity level 2 (SIL 2) and performance level d (PL d) with the HY-TTC 500 platform, the system integrator must verify several key aspects and ensure that all constraints are fulfilled by the system. Here are the detailed steps and verifications required:

1. **Evaluate Assumptions**:
   - The system integrator must evaluate the assumptions made during the lifecycle phases/activities applicable to the HY-TTC 500 ECU level. This includes verifying that these assumptions align with the overall safety-related system requirements as per the relevant standards (IEC 61508, ISO 13849, and ISO 25119).

2. **Lifecycle Phases**:
   - Conduct all lifecycle phases that are not or only partly applicable at the HY-TTC 500 ECU level for the overall safety-related system. This ensures comprehensive coverage of all safety lifecycle activities.

3. **Hazard and Risk Analysis**:
   - Perform a hazard and risk analysis for the system. This analysis should identify potential hazards and assess the associated risks. The system integrator must verify that the system requirements and overall safety requirements derived from this analysis match the properties of the HY-TTC 500 platform, such as performance level and reaction times.

4. **Safety Parameters Verification**:
   - Verify that the safety requirements of the system, as derived from the hazard and risk analysis, match the safety parameters of the HY-TTC 500. These parameters include:
     - Safety function
     - Process safety time
     - Proof test interval
     - Safety integrity level (SIL) or performance level (PL)

5. **System Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the system's safety functions with respect to the required safety integrity level and performance level. This evaluation should cover the entire system, including the application software developed by the system integrator. The methods described in IEC 61508, ISO 25119, and ISO 13849 should be used for this evaluation.

6. **Training and Qualification**:
   - Ensure that all persons involved in any lifecycle activity, including management activities, have the appropriate training, technical knowledge, experience, and qualifications relevant to their specific duties. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of the safety processes.

By meticulously following these steps and ensuring that all constraints are met, the system integrator can demonstrate that the HY-TTC 500 platform achieves the desired safety integrity level 2 (SIL 2) and performance level d (PL d)."

Category: Comment ID: 586823 In the safe state, no current will be applied to the safety-critical outputs of the ECU, i.e. in case of an error the safety-critical outputs will be switched off. One has to keep in mind, however, that the outputs are equipped with pull-up resistors to 5 V for diagnostic reasons. As this pull-up characteristic will not be disabled in the safe state, a minimal diagnostic current may flow through connected loads even in the safe state. The typical diagnostic currents are specified in the corresponding output's section within the HY-TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM], Part I: Hardware Description. <chunk_seperator> ![104_image_0.png]( The image displays a large white sheet of paper with various columns and rows of numbers. There are multiple tables on the paper, each containing different sets of data. Some of these tables have headings like ""1000"" and ""1500,"" indicating specific categories or sections within the data. <chunk_seperator> - **FPGA bitstream:** The HY-TTC 500 features an additional logic IC that is used for obtaining certain feedback values of safety-critical outputs. The FPGA's function can be updated by flashing a separate FPGA bitstream to the ECU. This bitstream is part of the HY-TTC 500 platform's software release package.

- **I/O driver library:** The I/O drivers are delivered to the system integrator in form of a C library and header files. The I/O drivers include: o software functions allowing to access the HY-TTC 500 interfaces and I/Os from the application software (e.g. controlling the PWM outputs, reading the analog inputs, communicating over the CAN interface)
o diagnostic modules that perform various I/O and CPU-internal tests at start-up and at runtime 
(e.g. RAM-tests, short circuit tests).

The interface between the application software and the HY‑TTC 500 safety platform is the I/O driver API 
as specified by the HY-TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM], Part II: Software Description. <chunk_seperator> ## 3 Safety Concept Overview - - -

Category: Comment ID: 586811 Special hardware and software functions are integrated into the HY-TTC 500 platform that allow the use in safety-critical applications. The following hardware and software components are part of the safety platform:
- **ECU hardware:** The HY-TTC 500 is equipped with a Main CPU and a Safety Companion acting as external watchdog. For a detailed I/O description, characteristics and maximum ratings refer to the HY‑TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM], Part I: Hardware Description.

- **Bootloader:** The bootloader will be executed after reset, performing application software download, checking and starting the application software.

- **Board support package (BSP):** Start-up code for the Main CPU that needs to be linked to the application software and linker command files (containing addresses and size of RAM, Flash and stack area). <chunk_seperator> Returns the status of a FIFO buffer.

Question:  What is the role of the bootloader in the HY-TTC 500 platform?","The bootloader in the HY-TTC 500 platform plays a crucial role in the initialization and management of the application software. Specifically, its functions include:

1. **Execution After Reset:** The bootloader is the first piece of software that runs when the system is reset. This ensures that the system starts in a controlled and predictable manner.

2. **Application Software Download:** It is responsible for downloading the application software onto the ECU. This is essential for updating or installing new software versions.

3. **Checking the Application Software:** Before starting the application software, the bootloader performs checks to ensure the integrity and correctness of the software. This step is critical for maintaining the reliability and safety of the system, especially in safety-critical applications.

4. **Starting the Application Software:** Once the application software has been downloaded and verified, the bootloader initiates its execution. This transition from the bootloader to the application software is a key step in the system's startup process.

Overall, the bootloader ensures that the application software is correctly loaded, verified, and started, thereby contributing to the overall safety and reliability of the HY-TTC 500 platform."

The typical diagnostic currents are specified in the corresponding output's section within the HY-TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM], Part I: Hardware Description. <chunk_seperator> ![104_image_0.png]( The image displays a large white sheet of paper with various columns and rows of numbers. There are multiple tables on the paper, each containing different sets of data. Some of these tables have headings like ""1000"" and ""1500,"" indicating specific categories or sections within the data. <chunk_seperator> - **FPGA bitstream:** The HY-TTC 500 features an additional logic IC that is used for obtaining certain feedback values of safety-critical outputs. The FPGA's function can be updated by flashing a separate FPGA bitstream to the ECU. This bitstream is part of the HY-TTC 500 platform's software release package.

- **I/O driver library:** The I/O drivers are delivered to the system integrator in form of a C library and header files. The I/O drivers include: o software functions allowing to access the HY-TTC 500 interfaces and I/Os from the application software (e.g. controlling the PWM outputs, reading the analog inputs, communicating over the CAN interface)
o diagnostic modules that perform various I/O and CPU-internal tests at start-up and at runtime 
(e.g. RAM-tests, short circuit tests).

The interface between the application software and the HY‑TTC 500 safety platform is the I/O driver API 
as specified by the HY-TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM], Part II: Software Description. <chunk_seperator> ## 3 Safety Concept Overview - - -

Category: Comment ID: 586811 Special hardware and software functions are integrated into the HY-TTC 500 platform that allow the use in safety-critical applications. The following hardware and software components are part of the safety platform:
- **ECU hardware:** The HY-TTC 500 is equipped with a Main CPU and a Safety Companion acting as external watchdog. For a detailed I/O description, characteristics and maximum ratings refer to the HY‑TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM], Part I: Hardware Description.

- **Bootloader:** The bootloader will be executed after reset, performing application software download, checking and starting the application software.

- **Board support package (BSP):** Start-up code for the Main CPU that needs to be linked to the application software and linker command files (containing addresses and size of RAM, Flash and stack area). <chunk_seperator> Returns the status of a FIFO buffer. Parameters handle CAN FIFO buffer handle (retrieved from **IO_CAN_ConfigFIFO()**)
Returns IO_ErrorType Return values

Question:  What happens to the safety-critical outputs of the HY-TTC 500 in the safe state?","In the safe state, the safety-critical outputs of the HY-TTC 500 are switched off, meaning no current will be applied to these outputs. This is a fail-safe measure to ensure that in case of an error, the system does not inadvertently activate any safety-critical functions. However, it is important to note that the outputs are equipped with pull-up resistors to 5 V for diagnostic purposes. As a result, even in the safe state, a minimal diagnostic current may still flow through the connected loads. The specific values of these diagnostic currents are detailed in the corresponding output's section of the HY-TTC 500 System Manual, Part I: Hardware Description."

Category: Comment ID: 590198 A safety-critical system component is a component that may cause hazardous conditions in case of a failure or malfunction. The following components of the HY-TTC 500 are defined as being safety-critical if any of the ECU's functions is used in a safety-critical application:

-

-

-

-

-

-
- Main CPU (including internal RAM and Flash)
- Safety Companion - Power supply and internal supply voltages
- Internal temperature monitoring
Category: Comment ID: 590200 The following components can be defined as being safety-critical dependent on the application and dangerous failures within these functional blocks can be detected by the HY-TTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules. For details about the internal failure diagnostics, please refer to section Guideline on Hardware Metrics Determination. <chunk_seperator> Category: Comment ID: 590202 The HY-TTC 500 platform's PWM stages are allocated to three different shut-off groups that feature separate shut-off paths, each. Thus—in case of certain failures—the application software can deenergize the one group with the erroneous PWM output, while keeping the remaining two groups operational. That way, the system integrator may implement a limp-home function which allows the system to run in a reduced mode, e.g. for returning to the workshop for repair.

Category: Requirement Label: Shutoff_Allocation ID: 590192 Related To: 320067 Related To':
If the system integrator independently controls the separate shut-off groups in case of failures, the actuators **shall** be allocated to the groups in such a way that does not introduce dangerous situations in reduced operation mode.

## 3.1.3 Safety-Critical System Components <chunk_seperator> Category: Comment ID: 1194971 For diagnostic reasons, the ECU's sensor supply outputs are not automatically switched off when entering the safe state. It is therefore not recommended to use the sensor supply outputs as a power source that should be disabled immediately, in case of a safe state transition.

Category: Comment ID: 587485 For diagnostic reasons, a minimum duty cycle is always applied to the safety-critical PWM stages as long as the CPU is in the state *Main*. This is the case, even if the application deliberately deactivates the corresponding outputs.

Question:  Why is it not recommended to use the ECU's sensor supply outputs as a power source that should be disabled immediately in case of a safe state transition?","It is not recommended to use the ECU's sensor supply outputs as a power source that should be disabled immediately in case of a safe state transition because the ECU's sensor supply outputs are not automatically switched off when entering the safe state. This design choice is made for diagnostic reasons, meaning that the sensor supply outputs remain active to allow for continued monitoring and diagnostics even when the system transitions to a safe state. Consequently, relying on these outputs for power that needs to be cut off immediately during a safe state transition could lead to unsafe conditions, as the power would not be disabled as required."

Question:  How are the PWM stages of the HY-TTC 500 platform allocated, and what functionality does this allocation provide in case of certain failures?","The PWM stages of the HY-TTC 500 platform are allocated into three different shut-off groups, each featuring separate shut-off paths. This allocation allows the application software to deenergize one group with an erroneous PWM output while keeping the remaining two groups operational. This functionality is crucial in case of certain failures, as it enables the system integrator to implement a limp-home function. The limp-home function allows the system to continue running in a reduced mode, which is particularly useful for safely returning the vehicle or machinery to a workshop for repair. This approach ensures that the system can maintain some level of operational capability even when a failure occurs, thereby enhancing the overall safety and reliability of the system."

Category: Comment ID: 723213 The HY-TTC 500 platform distinguishes between different errors with regards to the momentary failure reaction. Depending on the type of error, the I/O-driver's diagnostic modules will initiate specific actions. The following section describes those types of errors and the according HY-TTC 500 platform's behavior. A detailed failure classification into the different error types can be found in the I/O driver API within the TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM], Part II: Software Development.

## 3.1.4.1 Fatal Errors <chunk_seperator> ## - 3.1.4.2 Non-Fatal Error - - - -

Category: Comment ID: 723236 An error is classified as being non-fatal, if its occurrence does not prevent the safe program execution, per se. That may be because the error is clearly related to a contained subsystem of the ECU (e.g. an analog input stage) or the error is located outside of the ECU (e.g. an open circuit of a safety-critical actuator).

Non-fatal errors do not directly lead to the safe state. Instead, the I/O-driver diagnostics will execute the application-specific error callback, if it has been correctly passed during the driver initialization.

Category: Comment ID: 723232 An error is classified as being temporary, if it only persists over a time less than or equal to the specified glitch filter time. Also, only those errors that feature dynamic characteristics may fall into the category of temporary errors, e.g. a signal range violation of an analog input signal or an invalid readback voltage of a digital power stage. In case a temporary error persists over the defined glitch filter time, it may either turn into a fatal error or a non-fatal error, according to its consequence.

Question:  How does the HY-TTC 500 platform react to fatal errors?","The HY-TTC 500 platform has a specific reaction protocol for handling fatal errors. A fatal error is defined as an error that makes safe program execution impossible, regardless of the actual application. This includes errors that are inherently fatal in their consequences, such as RAM or register errors, or the activation of a safe state by the Safety Companion. Additionally, temporary errors that persist beyond the anti-glitch time are also classified as fatal.

When a fatal error is detected, the HY-TTC 500 platform's immediate response is to enter a safe state. This is a critical safety measure to prevent any further unsafe operations. If the system has been configured with the appropriate notification callback, the application software will be notified by the I/O-driver diagnostics about the fatal error. This allows the application to take any additional necessary actions or to log the error for further analysis.

In summary, the HY-TTC 500 platform's reaction to fatal errors involves:
1. Immediate transition to a safe state to halt unsafe operations.
2. Notification of the application software via the I/O-driver diagnostics, if the notification callback is configured.

This approach ensures that the system prioritizes safety and prevents any potentially hazardous situations from escalating."

This increased risk is attributed to the additional failure potential of the output circuit. Therefore, the system integrator is advised to either:

1. **Utilize the Dedicated Inputs**: Dedicated inputs are designed with a lower probability of dangerous failures and are more reliable for safety-critical applications. By using these inputs, the system integrator can ensure a higher level of safety and reliability.

2. **Provide Additional Means of Diagnostics**: If the system integrator chooses to use the secondary input function of dedicated outputs, they must implement additional diagnostic measures. These diagnostics are necessary to monitor and detect potential failures in the output circuit, thereby mitigating the increased risk associated with using these outputs as inputs.

Additionally, the system integrator is required to perform a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) for the system components. This analysis will help identify and evaluate the safety-critical I/Os for the system, ensuring that all potential failure modes are considered and addressed appropriately. The FMEA process is crucial for understanding the impact of different failure modes and implementing necessary safeguards to maintain system safety.

By following these guidelines, the system integrator can ensure that the inputs used in safety-critical systems are reliable and that any potential risks are adequately managed through dedicated inputs or enhanced diagnostics."

Category: Comment ID: 723224 An error is classified as being fatal, if a safe program execution is not possible anymore, regardless of the actual application. The following errors are characterized as being fatal:
- errors that are fatal in their consequence, so that an anti-glitch strategy is not feasible (e.g. RAM or register errors, safe state activation by the Safety Companion)
- temporary errors that persist over the anti-glitch time For fatal errors, the HY-TTC 500 platform's failure reaction is to enter the safe state immediately. If the according notification callback is configured, the application software will be notified by the I/O-driver diagnostics.

These outputs provide superior diagnostic measures for detecting failures within dynamically changing output signals.

## - - - 3.1.4 Failure Reaction In Case Of Errors -

Category: Comment ID: 723213 The HY-TTC 500 platform distinguishes between different errors with regards to the momentary failure reaction. Depending on the type of error, the I/O-driver's diagnostic modules will initiate specific actions. The following section describes those types of errors and the according HY-TTC 500 platform's behavior. A detailed failure classification into the different error types can be found in the I/O driver API within the TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM], Part II: Software Development.

## 3.1.4.1 Fatal Errors <chunk_seperator> ## - 3.1.4.2 Non-Fatal Error - - - -

Category: Comment ID: 723236 An error is classified as being non-fatal, if its occurrence does not prevent the safe program execution, per se. That may be because the error is clearly related to a contained subsystem of the ECU (e.g. an analog input stage) or the error is located outside of the ECU (e.g. an open circuit of a safety-critical actuator).

Non-fatal errors do not directly lead to the safe state. Instead, the I/O-driver diagnostics will execute the application-specific error callback, if it has been correctly passed during the driver initialization.

Category: Comment ID: 586825 The term 'typical driving cycle' describes the time interval between power-up and power-down, a vehicle is designed for. That means, driving cycles of more than 24 hours shall only happen on rare occasions and are to be exercised with the utmost caution, as the safety related tests performed upon start-up are no longer executed with the specified proof test interval.

Category: Comment ID: 813067 The effective reaction time of the core's diagnostics is based on the following parameters that can be adjusted during the I/O driver initialization call:
- Command period, i.e. the so-called cycle time (*t_cycle*): 1 … 50 ms
- Glitch filter time (*t_glitch*): 1 … 180 ms In addition, the external watchdog window time (*t_wd*) is defined to be 64 ms.

The configured glitch filter time correlates with the selected cycle time. Each specific failure diagnostic will be executed every sixth application cycle. Under worst case conditions, the applied glitch filter time will therefore increase to the next higher integer multiple of 6 * t_cycle. <chunk_seperator> Due to the fact, that a number of diagnostics is only performed during system start-up, the typical driving cycle is considered to be equal to the proof test interval.

Category: Comment ID: 813084 For calculating the worst case failure reaction time, the system integrator has to combine the core diagnostic's failure reaction time (being independent from the used I/Os) and the additional I/O related failure reaction time (taking into account the I/O specific diagnostic time delay). That way, the overall failure reaction time can be determined accurately, for each individual safety function.

## 7.7.2 Digital Output Protection

Each digital output is individually protected against overcurrent. Whenever a fatal overcurrent situation is detected on any safe or unsafe digital output, the output is disabled by software. Note that disabled by software means that the output is set to low but the state of the safety switch (if configured) remains unchanged.

When entering the protection state, the digital output has to remain in this state for the given wait time. After this wait time the digital output can be reenabled via function **IO_DO_ResetProtection()**. Note that the number of reenabling operations for a single digital output is limited to 10. Refer to function IO_DO_ResetProtection() for more information on how to reenable a digital output.

Category: Comment ID: 813067 The effective reaction time of the core's diagnostics is based on the following parameters that can be adjusted during the I/O driver initialization call:
- Command period, i.e. the so-called cycle time (*t_cycle*): 1 … 50 ms
- Glitch filter time (*t_glitch*): 1 … 180 ms In addition, the external watchdog window time (*t_wd*) is defined to be 64 ms.

The configured glitch filter time correlates with the selected cycle time. Each specific failure diagnostic will be executed every sixth application cycle. Under worst case conditions, the applied glitch filter time will therefore increase to the next higher integer multiple of 6 * t_cycle. <chunk_seperator> Due to the fact, that a number of diagnostics is only performed during system start-up, the typical driving cycle is considered to be equal to the proof test interval.

The system integrator **shall** consider the HY-TTC 500 platform's effective failure reaction time for each safety function.

Category: Comment ID: 813084 For calculating the worst case failure reaction time, the system integrator has to combine the core diagnostic's failure reaction time (being independent from the used I/Os) and the additional I/O related failure reaction time (taking into account the I/O specific diagnostic time delay). That way, the overall failure reaction time can be determined accurately, for each individual safety function.

## 7.7.2 Digital Output Protection

Each digital output is individually protected against overcurrent. Whenever a fatal overcurrent situation is detected on any safe or unsafe digital output, the output is disabled by software. Note that disabled by software means that the output is set to low but the state of the safety switch (if configured) remains unchanged.

When entering the protection state, the digital output has to remain in this state for the given wait time. After this wait time the digital output can be reenabled via function **IO_DO_ResetProtection()**. Note that the number of reenabling operations for a single digital output is limited to 10. Refer to function IO_DO_ResetProtection() for more information on how to reenable a digital output.

Question:  What is the purpose of the glitch filter time in the context of failing diagnostic checks?","The purpose of the glitch filter time in the context of failing diagnostic checks is to prevent sporadic external interferences from directly leading to the system's safe state. This is achieved by de-glitching a failing diagnostic check for a certain amount of time, which can be configured by the system integrator. The glitch filter time ensures that only persistent errors, which last longer than the specified glitch filter time, are signaled as actual failures. This helps in distinguishing between temporary anomalies, such as those caused by transient conditions like a low battery voltage during cold-start cranking, and genuine, persistent faults that require the system to take corrective action. By doing so, the system avoids unnecessary transitions to a safe state due to brief, non-critical disturbances."

Subsequently, the calculation of the core's effective worst case failure reaction time is as follows: wc_frt_core = max(((6+1) * t_cycle) + t_glitch_effective, t_wd)

## 4.5.5. Manufacturer-Specific Profile Area
Question:  How is the core's effective worst case failure reaction time calculated?","The core's effective worst case failure reaction time is calculated using a specific formula that takes into account several parameters that can be adjusted during the I/O driver initialization call. These parameters include the command period (cycle time, *t_cycle*), the glitch filter time (*t_glitch*), and the external watchdog window time (*t_wd*). Here is a detailed breakdown of the calculation process:

1. **Command Period (Cycle Time, *t_cycle*):** This is the time interval at which the diagnostics are executed. It can be set between 1 ms and 50 ms.

2. **Glitch Filter Time (*t_glitch*):** This is the time period used to filter out transient errors to prevent sporadic external interferences from causing the system to enter a safe state. It can be set between 1 ms and 180 ms.

3. **External Watchdog Window Time (*t_wd*):** This is a fixed time period set to 64 ms.

4. **Correlation Between Glitch Filter Time and Cycle Time:** The glitch filter time is correlated with the selected cycle time. Each specific failure diagnostic is executed every sixth application cycle. Therefore, under worst-case conditions, the effective glitch filter time will increase to the next higher integer multiple of 6 times the cycle time.

   \[
   t_{glitch\_effective} = \text{round\_to\_multiple}(t_{glitch}, 6 \times t_{cycle})
   \]

5. **Calculation of Core's Effective Worst Case Failure Reaction Time:** The formula to calculate the core's effective worst case failure reaction time is:

   \[
   wc\_frt\_core = \max(((6 + 1) \times t_{cycle}) + t_{glitch\_effective}, t_{wd})
   \]

   - The term \((6 + 1) \times t_{cycle}\) accounts for the time taken to complete seven cycles (one initial cycle plus six additional cycles).
   - \(t_{glitch\_effective}\) is the effective glitch filter time calculated as described above.
   - \(t_{wd}\) is the external watchdog window time, which is 64 ms.

6. **Range of Core's Calculated Worst Case Failure Reaction Time:** Depending on the safety parameters chosen by the application software, the core's calculated worst case failure reaction time can range between 64 ms and 650 ms.

In summary, the core's effective worst case failure reaction time is determined by combining the cycle time, the effective glitch filter time, and ensuring it is at least as long as the external watchdog window time. The formula ensures that the worst case scenario is accounted for, providing a reliable measure for safety-critical applications."

## 3.1.5.2.5 External Shut-Off Inputs

Category: Comment ID: 969439 The worst case reaction time for shutting off the corresponding safety switch groups via the external shutoff inputs is only dependent on the particular application cycle time. These analog shut-off inputs are sampled every 6th application cycle and the shut-off groups will be deactivated within the next application cycle or within 5 ms - whichever occurs first. wc_frt_extshutoff = (6 * t_cycle) + min(t_cycle; 5 ms)
Note: This formula assumes an ideal switch without bouncing and simultaneous switching times for both terminals. Depending on the chosen switch, further timing delays have to be considered.

## - 3.1.5.3 Calculation Examples - <chunk_seperator> Category: Comment ID: 813743

## Example 2: - <chunk_seperator> wc_frt_io_timer2kHz = 0.5 ms The additional failure reaction time caused by the 2 timer inputs with a frequency of 100 Hz is:
wc_frt_io_timer100Hz = 10 ms For the overall worst case calculation, the I/O type with the greatest influence, i.e. the digital high side outputs, will be used: wc_frt_io = wc_frt_io_dout = *20 ms* The overall failure reaction time for this exemplary configuration of the HY-TTC 500 platform is therefore:
wc_frt = wc_frt_core + wc_frt_io = 190 ms + 20 ms = 210 ms That means, the assumed diagnostic coverage for the I/O driver's core diagnostics is only valid for safety functions with a process safety time of 210 ms or higher. For those safety functions that require a shorter failure reaction time, the system integrator needs to either adapt the above-mentioned parameters or provide separate diagnostic measures within the application software. <chunk_seperator> Resistance sensors are, e. g., PTC resistors for temperature measurement.

Question:  How does the digital high side output affect the core's failure reaction time?","The digital high side output affects the core's failure reaction time by adding a fixed delay of 20 milliseconds. This is reflected in the formula:

\[ \text{wc\_frt\_io} = 20 \, \text{ms} \]

This means that regardless of other factors, the presence of a digital high side output will increase the core's worst case failure reaction time by 20 milliseconds. This fixed delay is significant when calculating the overall failure reaction time for a system, as it directly contributes to the total time required for the system to respond to a failure.

For example, in the provided calculation example, the additional failure reaction time caused by the digital high side outputs is explicitly stated as 20 milliseconds. This value is then used in the overall calculation of the worst case failure reaction time for the system:

\[ \text{wc\_frt\_io} = \text{wc\_frt\_io\_dout} = 20 \, \text{ms} \]

Thus, the digital high side output's impact is straightforward and consistent, adding a predictable and quantifiable delay to the core's failure reaction time."

Category: Comment ID: 969439 The worst case reaction time for shutting off the corresponding safety switch groups via the external shutoff inputs is only dependent on the particular application cycle time. These analog shut-off inputs are sampled every 6th application cycle and the shut-off groups will be deactivated within the next application cycle or within 5 ms - whichever occurs first. wc_frt_extshutoff = (6 * t_cycle) + min(t_cycle; 5 ms)

wc_frt_io_timer100Hz = 10 ms For the overall worst case calculation, the I/O type with the greatest influence, i.e. the digital high side outputs, will be used: wc_frt_io = wc_frt_io_dout = *20 ms* The overall failure reaction time for this exemplary configuration of the HY-TTC 500 platform is therefore:
wc_frt = wc_frt_core + wc_frt_io = 190 ms + 20 ms = 210 ms That means, the assumed diagnostic coverage for the I/O driver's core diagnostics is only valid for safety functions with a process safety time of 210 ms or higher. For those safety functions that require a shorter failure reaction time, the system integrator needs to either adapt the above-mentioned parameters or provide separate diagnostic measures within the application software. <chunk_seperator> Resistance sensors are, e. g., PTC resistors for temperature measurement.

## 3.1.5.2.5 External Shut-Off Inputs <chunk_seperator> An application software specifies the cycle time (*t_cycle*) to be 10 ms and the glitch filter time (*t_glitch*) to be 100 ms. A given safety function makes use of the following safety-related inputs and outputs: 
- 3 PWM high side outputs configured with an output frequency of 250 Hz 
- 2 digital high side outputs - 2 timer inputs being used with a frequency of 2 kHz, each 
- 2 timer inputs being used with a frequency of 100 Hz, each The resulting worst case failure reaction time of the core can be calculated as follows:
Question:  In Example 1, what is the overall failure reaction time for the given configuration of the HY-TTC 500 platform?","In Example 1, the overall failure reaction time for the given configuration of the HY-TTC 500 platform is calculated as follows:

1. **Effective Glitch Filter Time**:
   - Given: *t_glitch* = 100 ms and *t_cycle* = 10 ms.
   - Calculation: 
     \[
     t\_glitch\_effective = \text{round\_to\_multiple}(100 \text{ ms}, 6 \times 10 \text{ ms}) = 120 \text{ ms}
     \]
   - Explanation: The glitch filter time is rounded to the nearest multiple of 6 times the cycle time, resulting in 120 ms.

2. **Core Failure Reaction Time**:
   - Calculation:
     \[
     wc\_frt\_core = \max(((6+1) \times 10 \text{ ms}) + 120 \text{ ms}, 64 \text{ ms}) = 190 \text{ ms}
     \]
   - Explanation: The core failure reaction time is the maximum of the calculated value and 64 ms, resulting in 190 ms.

3. **PWM High Side Outputs**:
   - Given: 3 PWM high side outputs with an output frequency of 250 Hz.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     wc\_frt\_io\_pwm = 2 \times 4 \text{ ms} + 10 \text{ ms} = 18 \text{ ms}
     \]
   - Explanation: The PWM period is the inverse of the frequency (1/250 Hz = 4 ms). The failure reaction time is twice the PWM period plus an additional application cycle time.

4. **Digital High Side Outputs**:
   - Given: 2 digital high side outputs.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     wc\_frt\_io\_dout = 20 \text{ ms}
     \]
   - Explanation: Each digital high side output increases the failure reaction time by 20 ms.

5. **Timer Inputs**:
   - Given: 2 timer inputs with a frequency of 2 kHz and 2 timer inputs with a frequency of 100 Hz.
   - Calculation for 2 kHz inputs:
     \[
     wc\_frt\_io\_timer2kHz = 0.5 \text{ ms}
     \]
   - Calculation for 100 Hz inputs:
     \[
     wc\_frt\_io\_timer100Hz = 10 \text{ ms}
     \]
   - Explanation: The failure reaction time for timer inputs is the inverse of the frequency.

6. **Overall I/O Failure Reaction Time**:
   - The I/O type with the greatest influence is the digital high side outputs.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     wc\_frt\_io = wc\_frt\_io\_dout = 20 \text{ ms}
     \]

7. **Overall Failure Reaction Time**:
   - Calculation:
     \[
     wc\_frt = wc\_frt\_core + wc\_frt\_io = 190 \text{ ms} + 20 \text{ ms} = 210 \text{ ms}
     \]
   - Explanation: The overall failure reaction time is the sum of the core failure reaction time and the I/O failure reaction time.

Therefore, the overall failure reaction time for the given configuration of the HY-TTC 500 platform is **210 ms**."

Question:  How is the worst case failure reaction time of the core calculated in Example 2?","The worst case failure reaction time of the core in Example 2 is calculated through a series of steps involving the cycle time (*t_cycle*) and the glitch filter time (*t_glitch*). Here is a detailed breakdown of the calculation:

1. **Determine the Effective Glitch Filter Time:**
   - The glitch filter time (*t_glitch*) is given as 180 ms.
   - The cycle time (*t_cycle*) is specified as 1 ms.
   - The effective glitch filter time (*t_glitch_effective*) is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     t\_glitch\_effective = round\_to\_multiple(180 \text{ ms}, 6 \times 1 \text{ ms})
     \]
   - The function *round_to_multiple* means finding a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n \times 6 \times t\_cycle \geq t\_glitch \). In this case, \( n \) must be 30, resulting in:
     \[
     30 \times 6 \times 1 \text{ ms} = 180 \text{ ms}
     \]
   - Therefore, \( t\_glitch\_effective = 180 \text{ ms} \).

2. **Calculate the Core Failure Reaction Time:**
   - The core failure reaction time (*wc_frt_core*) is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     wc\_frt\_core = \max(((6 + 1) \times 1 \text{ ms}) + 180 \text{ ms}, 64 \text{ ms})
     \]
   - Breaking it down:
     - \( (6 + 1) \times 1 \text{ ms} = 7 \text{ ms} \)
     - Adding the effective glitch filter time: \( 7 \text{ ms} + 180 \text{ ms} = 187 \text{ ms} \)
     - The maximum value between 187 ms and 64 ms is 187 ms.
   - Therefore, \( wc\_frt\_core = 187 \text{ ms} \).

Thus, the worst case failure reaction time of the core is calculated to be 187 ms."

Question:  What are the additional failure reaction times caused by the PWM high side outputs, current measurement, and timer inputs in Example 2?","In Example 2, the additional failure reaction times caused by the PWM high side outputs, current measurement, and timer inputs are as follows:

1. **PWM High Side Outputs:**
   - The additional failure reaction time caused by the PWM high side outputs is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{wc\_frt\_io\_pwm} = 2 \times 2 \text{ ms} + 1 \text{ ms} = 5 \text{ ms}
     \]

2. **PWM High Side Current Measurement:**
   - The additional failure reaction time caused by the PWM high side current measurement is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{wc\_frt\_io\_current} = 20 \text{ ms} + 1 \text{ ms} = 21 \text{ ms}
     \]

3. **Timer Inputs:**
   - The additional failure reaction time caused by the 2 timer inputs with a frequency of 10 Hz is:
     \[
     \text{wc\_frt\_io\_timer} = 100 \text{ ms}
     \]

These times contribute to the overall worst-case failure reaction time calculation for the system."

## Example 2: -

An application software specifies the cycle time (*t_cycle*) to be 1 ms and the glitch filter time (*t_glitch*) to be 180 ms. A given safety function makes use of the following safety-related inputs and outputs: 
- 2 PWM high side outputs configured with an output frequency of 500 Hz and safety-relevant current measurement
- 2 timer inputs being used with a frequency of 10 Hz, each 
- 4 analog inputs The resulting worst case failure reaction time of the core can be calculated as follows: t_glitch_effective = round_to_multiple(180 ms, 6*1 ms) = 180 ms Note: *round_to_multiple* means to find a positive integer number n that fulfills *n*6*t_cycle >= t_glitch*. In this example n must be 30 which results in *30*6*10ms = 180ms*. <chunk_seperator> wc_frt_io = wc_frt_io_timer = 100 ms The overall failure reaction time for this exemplary configuration of the HY-TTC 500 platform is therefore: wc_frt = wc_frt_core + wc_frt_io = 187 ms + 100 ms = 287 ms That means, the assumed diagnostic coverage for the I/O driver's core diagnostics is only valid for safety functions with a process safety time of 287 ms or higher.

Question:  What are the key differences between the mission profiles MP_Conventional and MP_Stop-Go in terms of working cycles per day and temperature variations?","The key differences between the mission profiles MP_Conventional and MP_Stop-Go in terms of working cycles per day and temperature variations are as follows:

1. **Working Cycles per Day:**
   - **MP_Conventional:** This profile is targeted towards conventional off-highway vehicles that are typically operated continuously throughout the whole day. It assumes a relatively low number of operational cycles, specifically:
     - **Number of working cycles per day:** 5
   - **MP_Stop-Go:** This profile considers the common usage characteristics of stop-and-go applications, which involve a high number of very short working tasks throughout the typical working day. It assumes a significantly higher number of operational cycles, specifically:
     - **Number of working cycles per day:** 100

2. **Temperature Variations:**
   - **MP_Conventional:**
     - **Average temperature variation seen by the ECU's components each working cycle:** 35 °C
     - **Average temperature variation seen by the ECU's components each non-operational day:** 10 °C
   - **MP_Stop-Go:**
     - **Average temperature variation seen by the ECU's components each working cycle:** 5 °C
     - **Average temperature variation seen by the ECU's components each non-operational day:** 10 °C

In summary, MP_Conventional is characterized by fewer working cycles per day (5 cycles) with larger temperature variations per cycle (35 °C), while MP_Stop-Go is characterized by a higher number of working cycles per day (100 cycles) with smaller temperature variations per cycle (5 °C). Both profiles assume the same temperature variation during non-operational days (10 °C)."

Question:  What are the requirements for the system integrator regarding the use of the HY-TTC 500 platform's probabilistic values and the determination of the overall system's probabilistic values?","The system integrator has specific requirements regarding the use of the HY-TTC 500 platform's probabilistic values and the determination of the overall system's probabilistic values:

1. **Reliance on HY-TTC 500 Platform's Probabilistic Values**:
   - The system integrator **shall** rely on the HY-TTC 500 platform's probabilistic values only if the overall system characteristics are arguably comparable to one of the provided mission profiles, either *MP_Conventional* or *MP_Stop-Go*. This means that the system integrator must ensure that the operational conditions and usage patterns of the overall system align closely with those defined in the mission profiles used to calculate the probabilistic values for the HY-TTC 500 platform.

2. **Determination of Overall System's Probabilistic Values**:
   - The system integrator **shall** determine the actual probabilistic values for the entire system, which includes the HY-TTC 500 platform, sensors, actuators, and cabling. This involves calculating key safety metrics such as Probability of Failure per Hour (PFH), Safe Failure Fraction (SFF), Mean Time to Dangerous Failure (MTTFd), and Diagnostic Coverage (DCavg).
   - The system integrator **shall** verify that the probabilistic values of the overall system are within the limits specified in the relevant safety standards, namely IEC 61508, ISO 25119, and ISO 13849. This verification ensures that the system meets the required safety performance levels as dictated by these standards.

These requirements ensure that the system integrator not only uses the probabilistic values provided for the HY-TTC 500 platform appropriately but also takes into account the entire system's configuration and components to achieve a comprehensive safety assessment."

Question:  What are the two physically separated power supply connections in the HY-TTC 500 platform used for?","The HY-TTC 500 platform features two physically separated power supply connections, each serving a distinct purpose:

1. **ECU's Logic Unit**: One power supply connection is exclusively dedicated to the Electronic Control Unit's (ECU) logic unit. This ensures that the logic unit, which is responsible for processing and control functions, receives a stable and uninterrupted power supply.

2. **Power Stages**: The other power supply connection is designated for the power stages. These power stages are responsible for driving actuators and other high-power components within the system.

This separation of power supplies helps in isolating the sensitive logic circuitry from the high-power demands and potential electrical noise generated by the power stages, thereby enhancing the overall reliability and performance of the ECU."

Question:  What is the consequence of using a power switch that independently disconnects the supply for the internal logic core and decouples both power supply rails from each other?","Using a power switch that independently disconnects the supply for the internal logic core (BAT+ CPU) and decouples both power supply rails from each other has several important consequences:

1. **Enhanced Safety and Reliability**: This configuration ensures that in the event of external short circuits on the actuator lines, the power switch can still deenergize the ECU's logic core. This means that the overall ECU can be shut down safely, preventing potential damage to the system and ensuring that the ECU does not remain powered in an unsafe state.

2. **Prevention of Reverse Conduction Issues**: By decoupling the power supply rails, the risk of reverse conduction through the power stages is mitigated. This is particularly important because, in some configurations, reverse conduction could inadvertently keep the terminal 15 input supplied even when the power switch is activated, leading to unintended behavior or failure to properly shut down the ECU.

3. **Loss of Software-Controlled After-Run**: One significant trade-off of this configuration is that it does not support a software-controlled after-run. After-run functionality allows the ECU to continue operating for a short period after the ignition is turned off, which can be useful for tasks such as data logging, cooling down components, or completing critical operations. Without this capability, the ECU will shut down immediately when the power switch is activated, which might not be desirable in all applications.

4. **Compliance with Requirements**: This wiring configuration aligns with the requirements specified in the context, particularly the requirement labeled ""Supply_Separation"" (ID: 591649). It ensures that the power switch disconnects the ECU's logic supply and separates it from the power stage supply, thereby meeting the system integrator's obligation to provide a reliable means of deactivation.

In summary, while using a power switch that independently disconnects the supply for the internal logic core and decouples both power supply rails enhances safety and reliability by ensuring proper shutdown in case of external short circuits, it also means that the system will not support a software-controlled after-run, which could be a limitation depending on the specific application requirements."

Category: Comment ID: 592155 The following section describes the requirements for utilization of input stages in safety-critical environments. Whenever a requirement demands the redundant usage of specific inputs, this redundancy does only correspond to the HY-TTC 500 input stage. The sensor, however, may feature a single channel architecture, as long as it is connected to both used inputs, in parallel. Still, the system integrator is responsible for calculating the overall dangerous failure rate of the complete channel involved in the execution of a safety function. The redundancy of input stages may also be established by combining different types of input stages—as long as both of the utilized input types support the desired mode of operation.

- *IO_PWD_UniversalGet()* - *IO_PWD_GetCurrent()* Note 1: If a universal timer channel is co-configured for incremental mode together with any other combination of modes both the primary and secondary channel are redundantly configured.

Category: Comment ID: 592155 The following section describes the requirements for utilization of input stages in safety-critical environments. Whenever a requirement demands the redundant usage of specific inputs, this redundancy does only correspond to the HY-TTC 500 input stage. The sensor, however, may feature a single channel architecture, as long as it is connected to both used inputs, in parallel. Still, the system integrator is responsible for calculating the overall dangerous failure rate of the complete channel involved in the execution of a safety function. The redundancy of input stages may also be established by combining different types of input stages—as long as both of the utilized input types support the desired mode of operation.

Question:  What are the requirements for utilizing input stages in safety-critical environments according to the context?","The requirements for utilizing input stages in safety-critical environments are detailed and specific to ensure the reliability and safety of the system. Here are the key points:

1. **Redundant Usage of Inputs**:
   - Redundancy is required for specific inputs in safety-critical environments.
   - This redundancy pertains only to the HY-TTC 500 input stage.
   - The sensor itself can have a single-channel architecture as long as it is connected to both used inputs in parallel.
   - The system integrator is responsible for calculating the overall dangerous failure rate of the complete channel involved in executing a safety function.
   - Redundancy can also be established by combining different types of input stages, provided both types support the desired mode of operation.

2. **Digital Timer Inputs**:
   - Digital timer inputs 0-5 (*IO_PWD_00* ... *IO_PWD_05*) are equipped with necessary diagnostic measures and are suitable for safety-critical applications if the specified requirements are followed.
   - Digital timer inputs 6-11 (*IO_PWD_06* ... *IO_PWD_11*) lack the same diagnostic measures and are not suitable for safety-critical applications without additional restrictions. For their suitability, refer to the section *Guideline on Hardware Metrics Determination*.

3. **Periodic Triggering of Measurements**:
   - For each safety-critical timer input stage, the application must periodically trigger the measurement of pulse high-time, pulse low-time, period width, frequency, or number of edges for pulsed sensor signals using the appropriate driver functions:
     - *IO_PWD_ComplexGet()*
     - *IO_PWD_IncGet()*
     - *IO_PWD_CountGet()*
     - *IO_PWD_UniversalGet()*
     - *IO_PWD_GetCurrent()*
   - If a universal timer channel is co-configured for incremental mode along with any other combination of modes, both the primary and secondary channels must be redundantly configured. Thus, for safety-critical configurations, the application software needs to periodically trigger measurements for both channels in complex or edge count modes.
   - If a complex timer channel is configured as a safety-critical current timer input (parameter *pupd =* IO_PWD_PD_90), the current measurement function *IO_PWD_GetCurrent()* must be called alongside one of the four remaining timer step functions.

4. **Sensor Selection**:

Category: Comment ID: 592155 The following section describes the requirements for utilization of input stages in safety-critical environments. Whenever a requirement demands the redundant usage of specific inputs, this redundancy does only correspond to the HY-TTC 500 input stage. The sensor, however, may feature a single channel architecture, as long as it is connected to both used inputs, in parallel. Still, the system integrator is responsible for calculating the overall dangerous failure rate of the complete channel involved in the execution of a safety function. The redundancy of input stages may also be established by combining different types of input stages—as long as both of the utilized input types support the desired mode of operation.

Question:  What actions must the application software periodically trigger for each safety-critical timer input stage?","For each safety-critical timer input stage, the application software must periodically trigger the measurement of various parameters related to pulsed sensor signals. These parameters include:

1. **Pulse High-Time**: The duration for which the pulse remains in the high state.
2. **Pulse Low-Time**: The duration for which the pulse remains in the low state.
3. **Period Width**: The total duration of one complete cycle of the pulse.
4. **Frequency**: The number of pulse cycles per unit time.
5. **Number of Edges**: The count of transitions from low to high or high to low states.

To achieve these measurements, the application software should utilize the appropriate driver functions, which are:

- **IO_PWD_ComplexGet()**: For complex pulse width measurements.
- **IO_PWD_IncGet()**: For incremental pulse width measurements.
- **IO_PWD_CountGet()**: For counting the number of edges.
- **IO_PWD_UniversalGet()**: For universal pulse width measurements.
- **IO_PWD_GetCurrent()**: For measuring the current pulse width.

Additionally, there are specific notes to consider:

- **Note 1**: If a universal timer channel is co-configured for incremental mode along with any other combination of modes, both the primary and secondary channels must be redundantly configured. Therefore, for safety-critical configurations, the application software needs to periodically trigger the measurement for both channels in complex or edge count modes.
- **Note 2**: If a complex timer channel is configured as a safety-critical current timer input (parameter *pupd = IO_PWD_PD_90*), the current measurement function *IO_PWD_GetCurrent()* must be called alongside one of the four remaining timer step functions.

These actions ensure that the safety-critical timer input stages are continuously monitored and diagnosed, maintaining the integrity and reliability of the system in safety-critical applications."

## 7.7.2 Digital Output Protection

Each digital output is individually protected against overcurrent. Whenever a fatal overcurrent situation is detected on any safe or unsafe digital output, the output is disabled by software. Note that disabled by software means that the output is set to low but the state of the safety switch (if configured) remains unchanged.

When entering the protection state, the digital output has to remain in this state for the given wait time. After this wait time the digital output can be reenabled via function **IO_DO_ResetProtection()**. Note that the number of reenabling operations for a single digital output is limited to 10. Refer to function IO_DO_ResetProtection() for more information on how to reenable a digital output.

Detailed information about fatal overcurrent situations, **the reaction time and wait time are listed in** the following table. <chunk_seperator> Category: Requirement Label: Timer_Limits ID: 592205 Related To: 290425 Related To':

## 7.7.2 Digital Output Protection

Each digital output is individually protected against overcurrent. Whenever a fatal overcurrent situation is detected on any safe or unsafe digital output, the output is disabled by software. Note that disabled by software means that the output is set to low but the state of the safety switch (if configured) remains unchanged.

When entering the protection state, the digital output has to remain in this state for the given wait time. After this wait time the digital output can be reenabled via function **IO_DO_ResetProtection()**. Note that the number of reenabling operations for a single digital output is limited to 10. Refer to function IO_DO_ResetProtection() for more information on how to reenable a digital output.

## 7.7.2 Digital Output Protection

Each digital output is individually protected against overcurrent. Whenever a fatal overcurrent situation is detected on any safe or unsafe digital output, the output is disabled by software. Note that disabled by software means that the output is set to low but the state of the safety switch (if configured) remains unchanged.

When entering the protection state, the digital output has to remain in this state for the given wait time. After this wait time the digital output can be reenabled via function **IO_DO_ResetProtection()**. Note that the number of reenabling operations for a single digital output is limited to 10. Refer to function IO_DO_ResetProtection() for more information on how to reenable a digital output.

## 4.2.2.1 General

Category: Comment ID: 592219 The HY-TTC 500 platform provides the following types of analog inputs that can be used for safetycritical applications:
- 3 mode analog inputs (for voltage and current measurement), configurable by software
- 2 mode analog inputs (for voltage and current measurement), configurable by software Note: The HY-TTC 500 platform does not provide diagnostic measures for the 3 mode analog inputs' resistive measurement setting. If a specific diagnostic coverage is required for usage within safety-critical applications, the system integrator has to provide means to detect failures within these input stages. <chunk_seperator> ## Remarks - **The Supported Features Depend On The Selected Channel:**
Question:  What diagnostic measures do the analog 2 mode inputs provide, and what are the voltage measurement ranges for these inputs?","The analog 2 mode inputs on the HY-TTC 500 platform provide the necessary diagnostic measures to be used in safety-critical applications, provided that the requirements outlined in the relevant sections are adhered to. These diagnostic measures ensure that the analog 2 mode inputs can reliably function in environments where safety is a critical concern.

Regarding the voltage measurement ranges for the analog 2 mode inputs, they are configurable by software and are as follows:

- For analog inputs IO_ADC_08 to IO_ADC_15, the voltage measurement range is 0 to 5 V or 0 to 10 V.
- For analog inputs IO_ADC_16 to IO_ADC_23, the voltage measurement range is 0 to 5 V or 0 to 32 V.

These configurations allow the system integrator to select the appropriate voltage range based on the specific requirements of the application."

Category: Comment ID: 592276 The PWM high side stages (*IO_PWM_00* ... *IO_PWM_35*) provide the necessary diagnostic measures and are usable for safety-critical applications, when adhering to the subsequent requirements. Every PWM high side stage also provides a dedicated current measurement function that can also be utilized for safety-critical functions, if required for a given system.

Category: Comment ID: 592272 Typically, the PWM high side stages of the HY-TTC 500 platform will be used for controlling valves. For a safe operation of these valves, the safety platform monitors the duty cycle and frequency of the PWM signals, at runtime. In addition, the outputs are checked for short circuits to ground or power supply as well as for open circuits (e.g. cable break). <chunk_seperator> Category: Requirement Label: PWM_Minimum_Energy ID: 592111 Related To: Related To':
The system integrator **shall** ensure that the PWM stage's lower duty cycle limit (i.e. the minimum possible duty cycle) does not already energize the connected actuator in a way that could lead to a dangerous situation.

Category: Comment ID: 919117 The minimum possible duty cycle results from the minimum pulse length (100 µs) that is present even if the application software deactivates a safety-critical high side stage. Depending on the configured PWM frequency, the minimum duty cycle might go up to a value of 10 %, i.e. for a PWM frequency of 1000 Hz.

The duty cycle limits and duty cycle tolerances are defined in the I/O driver.

Question:  What diagnostic measures do the PWM high side stages provide for safety-critical applications?","The PWM high side stages of the HY-TTC 500 platform provide several diagnostic measures to ensure safe operation, particularly for safety-critical applications. These measures include:

1. **Current Measurement Function**: Each PWM high side stage has a dedicated current measurement function that can be utilized for safety-critical functions. This allows for continuous monitoring of the current flowing through the stage, ensuring it operates within safe parameters.

2. **Duty Cycle and Frequency Monitoring**: The safety platform monitors the duty cycle and frequency of the PWM signals at runtime. This ensures that the signals controlling the actuators, such as valves, are within the expected operational range.

3. **Short Circuit and Open Circuit Detection**: The outputs are checked for short circuits to ground or power supply, as well as for open circuits (e.g., cable breaks). This helps in identifying and mitigating potential faults that could lead to unsafe conditions.

4. **Test Pulse for Diagnostic Measurements**: The nature of the PWM signal, with its steadily changing voltage levels, is used to compare the desired signal sequence with the actual measurement. This comparison is facilitated by limiting the minimum and maximum duty cycles to ensure a test pulse is always present. This test pulse is used for continuously testing the ability to deactivate the power stages.

5. **Duty Cycle Limits and Tolerances**: The duty cycle limits and tolerances are defined in the I/O driver. These limits ensure that the PWM stage's lower duty cycle does not energize the connected actuator in a way that could lead to a dangerous situation. The system integrator must ensure that the minimum possible duty cycle does not pose a risk.

6. **Error Handling and Safe State Entry**: Depending on the initial I/O driver configuration, the HY-TTC 500 will either directly enter a safe state or leave the decision to the application software via an optional error callback. This provides a mechanism to handle errors and ensure the system can transition to a safe state if necessary.

7. **Secondary Shut-Off Path (Safety Switch)**: Each PWM high side stage features an internal secondary shut-off path, known as the safety switch. Up to three separate safety switches are available, each allocated to a predefined group of PWM high side stages. This allows for an additional layer of safety by providing a means to de-energize the stages in case of a fault.

8. **Impact of External Short Circuits**: The system integrator must consider the possibility of an external short circuit to battery voltage at a PWM high side stage's connector pin. Such a short circuit could affect all high side stages sharing the same internal safety switch, potentially preventing the safety switch from de-energizing. This consideration is crucial when allocating connector pins to the system's safety functions.

9. **Feedback Measurements**: For each safety-critical PWM output, the application must periodically call the PWM high side stage's appropriate task function (*IO_PWM_SetDuty()*) to trigger feedback measurements. This ensures continuous monitoring and validation of the PWM signal's integrity.

These diagnostic measures collectively ensure that the PWM high side stages can be safely used in safety-critical applications by providing continuous monitoring, fault detection, and mechanisms to transition to a safe state in case of anomalies."

Question:  How does the HY-TTC 500 platform ensure the safe operation of valves controlled by PWM high side stages?","The HY-TTC 500 platform ensures the safe operation of valves controlled by PWM high side stages through a combination of diagnostic measures, monitoring, and safety mechanisms. Here are the key aspects of how it achieves this:

1. **Diagnostic Measures and Current Measurement**:
   - Each PWM high side stage provides necessary diagnostic measures and a dedicated current measurement function. These features are crucial for safety-critical applications, allowing continuous monitoring and diagnostics of the system's performance.

2. **Monitoring Duty Cycle and Frequency**:
   - The safety platform monitors the duty cycle and frequency of the PWM signals at runtime. This ensures that the signals controlling the valves are within the expected parameters, preventing unsafe operation.

3. **Short Circuit and Open Circuit Detection**:
   - The system checks the outputs for short circuits to ground or power supply and for open circuits (e.g., cable breaks). This helps in identifying and mitigating potential faults that could lead to unsafe conditions.

4. **Test Pulse for Diagnostic Measurements**:
   - The nature of the PWM signal, with its steadily changing voltage levels, is used to compare the desired signal sequence with the actual measurement. This comparison allows for continuous testing of the system's ability to deactivate the power stages. The minimum and maximum duty cycles are limited to ensure a test pulse is always present for diagnostic purposes.

5. **Duty Cycle Limits and Tolerances**:
   - The duty cycle limits and tolerances are defined in the I/O driver. Depending on the initial configuration, the system will either enter a safe state directly or leave the decision to the application software via an optional error callback.

6. **Minimum Duty Cycle Considerations**:
   - The system integrator must ensure that the lower duty cycle limit does not energize the connected actuator in a way that could lead to a dangerous situation. The minimum possible duty cycle results from the minimum pulse length (100 µs), which might go up to 10% depending on the configured PWM frequency.

7. **Frequency Handling**:
   - If an unsupported PWM frequency is initialized, the I/O driver will use the next higher available frequency. For frequencies that do not result in a period of an integral multiple of 1 ms, the I/O driver provides averaged values calculated over 2 or 4 PWM periods.

8. **Internal Safety Switches**:
   - Each PWM high side stage features an internal secondary shut-off path, known as the safety switch. Depending on the device variant, up to three separate safety switches are available, each allocated to a predefined group of PWM high side stages. This allocation is detailed in the HY-TTC 500 System Manual.

9. **Impact of Short Circuits**:
   - Due to the reverse conducting characteristics of the PWM high side stages, a short circuit to battery voltage at any PWM high side output's connector pin can influence the safety integrity of all remaining high side stages sharing the same safety switch. The system integrator must evaluate the criticality of such failures when allocating connector pins to the system's safety functions.

10. **Periodic Task Function Calls**:
    - For each safety-critical PWM output, the application must periodically call the PWM high side stage's appropriate task function (*IO_PWM_SetDuty()*) to trigger feedback measurements. This ensures continuous monitoring and validation of the PWM signals.

Question:  What is the minimum pulse length for the PWM high side stages, and how does it affect the minimum duty cycle?","The minimum pulse length for the PWM high side stages is 100 microseconds (µs). This minimum pulse length is present even if the application software deactivates a safety-critical high side stage. The effect of this minimum pulse length on the minimum duty cycle depends on the configured PWM frequency. For instance, at a PWM frequency of 1000 Hz, the minimum duty cycle might go up to a value of 10%. This means that regardless of the desired duty cycle, the system will always generate a pulse of at least 100 µs, which translates to a minimum duty cycle of 10% at 1000 Hz. This ensures that there is always a test pulse available for diagnostic measurements, which is crucial for continuously testing the ability to deactivate the power stages."

Question:  What should the system integrator consider regarding the impact of an external short circuit to battery voltage at a PWM high side stage's connector pin?","The system integrator should consider several critical aspects regarding the impact of an external short circuit to battery voltage at a PWM high side stage's connector pin:

1. **Safety Integrity Impact**: Due to the reverse conducting characteristics of the PWM high side stages, a short circuit to battery voltage at any PWM high side output's connector pin can influence the safety integrity of all remaining high side stages that share the same safety switch. This is because the short circuit might prevent the single safety switch from de-energizing, thereby compromising the safety of the entire group of high side stages connected to that switch.

2. **Safety Switch Allocation**: The system integrator should carefully evaluate the allocation of the HY-TTC 500 platform's connector pins to the system's safety functions. This involves understanding the predefined groups of PWM high side stages that share the same safety switch and ensuring that the criticality of potential failures is minimized.

3. **Secondary Functions**: These considerations are also relevant when using the PWM high side stages' secondary functions, such as digital or frequency input capabilities. The system integrator must ensure that the safety integrity is not compromised when these secondary functions are utilized.

4. **Diagnostic Measures**: The system integrator should ensure that the diagnostic measures provided by the PWM high side stages are effectively utilized. This includes monitoring the duty cycle and frequency of the PWM signals, checking for short circuits to ground or power supply, and detecting open circuits.

5. **Periodic Feedback Measurements**: For each safety-critical PWM output, the application must periodically call the PWM high side stage's appropriate task function *IO_PWM_SetDuty()* to trigger the feedback measurements. This ensures continuous monitoring and diagnostic of the PWM stages.

6. **Minimum Duty Cycle**: The system integrator must ensure that the lower duty cycle limit does not energize the connected actuator in a way that could lead to a dangerous situation. The minimum possible duty cycle results from the minimum pulse length (100 µs), and depending on the configured PWM frequency, it might go up to a value of 10%.

By considering these factors, the system integrator can effectively manage the impact of an external short circuit to battery voltage at a PWM high side stage's connector pin and maintain the safety integrity of the system."

The MPU defines the CPU'**s access permissions to the full address space. There are several protection checks built in the IO_MPU API functions that prevent incorrect configuration, though ultimately** the user application is in control. The application'**s MPU configuration can deny access to the memory for the unsafe code as well as the I/O Driver functions, thus preventing the correct functionality**
of the I/O Driver. This chapter lists the requirements that the user application must follow in order to avoid interfering with the I/O Driver.

## 3.2.1 I/O Driver Memory Sections

The following requirements ensure that the I/O Driver has sufficient access permissions to the I/O Driver code, constants and data memory. The memory sections **are defined in the linker file (.lsf)** which is part of the I/O Driver release package. <chunk_seperator> The next step depends on the content of the flash memory:

The first screen shows an error message, while the second one indicates that the installation is progressing. There are also several icons and files visible in both screens, including a ""connect to TC downloader"" option.

In addition to these screens, there are multiple windows open on each screen, with some of them displaying information about the software installation process. The presence of various icons and files suggests that this is an active installation process taking place on the computer.)

Question:  What happens if a digital high side output's state is changed with a period shorter than 20 ms on the HY-TTC 500 platform?","If a digital high side output's state is changed with a period shorter than 20 ms on the HY-TTC 500 platform, the platform's diagnostics will be unable to read correct feedback values. This inability to read accurate feedback will result in a persistent error condition. Consequently, the application software's error callback function will be executed to handle this error condition. This persistent error condition can disrupt the normal operation of the system and may lead to safety concerns if not properly managed. Therefore, it is crucial to avoid changing the state of a digital high side output with such a rapid period to ensure the diagnostics can function correctly and provide accurate feedback."

Question:  What should the system integrator use for operating high side outputs with periodically changing states and a period shorter than the HYTTC 500 platform's overall worst case failure reaction time?","For operating high side outputs with periodically changing states and a period shorter than the HYTTC 500 platform's overall worst case failure reaction time, the system integrator should utilize the dedicated PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) high side outputs. These outputs are specifically designed to handle dynamically changing output signals and provide superior diagnostic measures for detecting failures within such signals. This ensures that the system can maintain accurate diagnostics and reliable operation even under conditions of rapid state changes."

Question:  What permissions does the I/O Driver code need if the Memory Protection Unit (MPU) is used, and in which memory sections?","If the Memory Protection Unit (MPU) is used, the I/O Driver code requires specific permissions for various memory sections to ensure proper functionality and adherence to safety requirements. The permissions and memory sections are as follows:

1. **RAM Memory Sections:**
   - **Read and Write Permissions:**
     - CSM_VAR_ZERO_INIT_UNSPECIFIED

Additionally, the I/O Driver code executes in both the main application thread and during exceptions. Therefore, the requirements for MPU access permissions must be fulfilled in both contexts. In the main thread, the application must enable and disable the User MPU regions using the IO_MPU API functions as needed to comply with the I/O Driver requirements and the specific safety requirements of the application. For instance, if a User MPU region is configured to deny access to one of the I/O Driver memory sections, this region must be disabled from the API before any I/O Driver function can be called."

Question:  What is the role of the C-driver API in the interface between the application and the HY-TTC 500 platform?","The C-driver API plays a crucial role in the interface between the application and the HY-TTC 500 platform. It serves as the primary means through which the application software interacts with the platform's hardware and peripherals. Here are the key aspects of its role:

1. **Definition of Interface**: The C-driver API defines the interface between the application and the HY-TTC 500 platform. This means it provides the necessary functions and protocols that the application software must use to communicate with the hardware components of the platform.

2. **Control and Configuration**: The API functions within the HY-TTC 500 I/O driver C library allow for the control and configuration of the CPU and its peripherals. This includes setting up various hardware parameters and ensuring that the application can effectively manage the hardware resources.

3. **Safety and Functionality**: The API ensures that the application software can perform necessary diagnostic measures to guarantee the safe operation of the HY-TTC 500 ECU under foreseeable conditions. This is critical for maintaining the safety and reliability of the system.

4. **Compatibility with Generated Code**: In cases where the application software is not written in C but is generated using tools like Matlab/Simulink, the system integrator must ensure that the generated object or C-code is correct. This involves performing appropriate tests to fulfill the respective safety performance requirements, ensuring that the generated code can correctly interface with the C-driver API.

5. **Prohibition of Register Modification**: To avoid malfunctions caused by interference between driver software and application software, the system integrator is prohibited from modifying any CPU registers. This restriction underscores the importance of using the C-driver API as the sole means of interacting with the CPU and peripherals, ensuring that all interactions are safe and controlled.

6. **Safe State Transition**: The C-driver API provides specific functions, such as `DIAG_EnterSafestate()`, which allow the application to transition the system into a safe state in case of fatal errors. This function is essential for maintaining system safety and ensuring that the application can handle critical errors appropriately.

In summary, the C-driver API is essential for defining the interaction between the application and the HY-TTC 500 platform, ensuring safe and effective control and configuration of the hardware, and providing mechanisms for maintaining system safety and reliability."

Category: Comment ID: 921278 The PWM high side stages allow operation of both resistive and inductive loads in a safety-critical manner. Due to the PWM control, they feature a continuous monitoring mechanism in the granularity of the PWM frequency. With internal safety switches being able to override a faulty power stage output, an independent secondary shut-off path is present to transfer the system to a safe state, in case of dangerous failures. <chunk_seperator> - The behavior in exceptions depends on the selected MPU protection policy as configured in the IO_MPU API. Depending on the setting, the I/O Driver automatically disables selected User MPU 
regions in order to ensure the necessary access permissions.

Category: Comment ID: 717254 The following example outlines the procedure for calculating the worst case failure reaction time for a user application that utilizes redundant timer inputs with an assumed cycle time (*t_cycle*) of 10 ms and a consistency check for the redundant inputs that is executed every fourth application cycle 
(*n_rounds_check*).

-

-
The resulting worst case failure reaction time is: wc_frt = max(10 ms * (4 + 1), 64 ms) *= 64 ms* That means, the assumed diagnostic coverage for the timer input's safety mechanism (*redundancy*) is only valid for safety functions with a process safety time of 64 ms or higher. For those safety functions that require a shorter failure reaction time, the system integrator needs to either adapt the abovementioned parameters or provide separate diagnostic measures within the application software. <chunk_seperator> ## 7.15.2.405 #Define Io_Pwm_15 Io_Pin_178

Category: Requirement Label: Stack_Check ID: 718462 Related To: Related To':
The safety measures of the HY-TTC 500 platform do not check for stack overflows. The system integrator **shall** apply appropriate measures to check the stack, by means of e.g.:

- <chunk_seperator> The effective reaction time is based on the following parameters:
- The maximum cycle time (*t_cycle*) that is defined during the I/O driver initialization call
- The interval between the execution of the consistency check (*n_rounds_check*) in software cycles
- The external watchdog window time (*t_wd*) that is defined to be 64 ms. The calculation of the effective worst case failure reaction time is as follows: wc_frt = *max(t_cycle * (n_rounds_check + 1), t_wd)*
Compliance with the system's failure reaction time has been assumed during the HY-TTC 500 platform's FMEDA. Consequently, the effective diagnostic coverage for the relevant system components is only valid, if the application software's consistency checks are executed with an adequate frequency.

Question:  What parameters are used to calculate the effective worst case failure reaction time in the context of safety-critical system components?","The effective worst case failure reaction time for safety-critical system components is calculated using the following parameters:

1. **Maximum Cycle Time (*t_cycle*)**: This is the maximum time for one complete cycle of the system, defined during the I/O driver initialization call.

2. **Interval Between Consistency Checks (*n_rounds_check*)**: This is the number of software cycles between each execution of the consistency check.

3. **External Watchdog Window Time (*t_wd*)**: This is a predefined time window for the external watchdog, set to 64 milliseconds.

The formula to calculate the effective worst case failure reaction time (*wc_frt*) is:
\[ wc_frt = \max(t\_cycle \times (n\_rounds\_check + 1), t\_wd) \]

This calculation ensures that the system's failure reaction time is within acceptable limits, which is crucial for maintaining the diagnostic coverage and overall safety of the system."

Question:  How is the worst case failure reaction time calculated for a user application with a cycle time of 10 ms and a consistency check executed every fourth application cycle?","The worst case failure reaction time (wc_frt) for a user application with a cycle time (*t_cycle*) of 10 ms and a consistency check executed every fourth application cycle (*n_rounds_check*) is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{wc_frt} = \max(t_{\text{cycle}} \times (n_{\text{rounds\_check}} + 1), t_{\text{wd}}) \]

Given the parameters:
- *t_cycle* = 10 ms
- *n_rounds_check* = 4
- *t_wd* = 64 ms (external watchdog window time)

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ \text{wc_frt} = \max(10 \, \text{ms} \times (4 + 1), 64 \, \text{ms}) \]
\[ \text{wc_frt} = \max(10 \, \text{ms} \times 5, 64 \, \text{ms}) \]
\[ \text{wc_frt} = \max(50 \, \text{ms}, 64 \, \text{ms}) \]
\[ \text{wc_frt} = 64 \, \text{ms} \]

Therefore, the worst case failure reaction time is 64 ms. This means that the assumed diagnostic coverage for the timer input's safety mechanism (redundancy) is only valid for safety functions with a process safety time of 64 ms or higher. For safety functions requiring a shorter failure reaction time, the system integrator must either adjust the parameters or implement additional diagnostic measures within the application software."

Question:  What protection mechanisms are in place for the Main CPU's internal Flash, configuration flash, and RAM memories?","The Main CPU's internal Flash, configuration flash, and RAM memories are protected by Single Error Correction Double Error Detection (SECDED). This mechanism provides the following protections:

1. **Single Bit Errors**: These errors are automatically corrected by the SECDED mechanism, ensuring that minor errors do not affect the system's operation.

2. **Double Bit Errors**: These errors are detected by the SECDED mechanism. While they are not corrected automatically, their detection allows the system to take appropriate action to handle the error.

Additionally, the system may require the application to monitor and check for stricter limits on the number of correctable single bit errors. If the count of corrected single bit errors exceeds the required limits, the application software must activate a safe state to ensure system safety.

To facilitate monitoring, the I/O driver interfaces provide specific functions to retrieve the error counts for each memory type:
- **Flash Memory**: `DIAG_GetFlashErrors()`
- **Configuration Flash Memory**: `DIAG_GetCfgFlashErrors()`
- **RAM Memory**: `DIAG_GetRamB0Errors()` and `DIAG_GetRamB1Errors()`

Furthermore, the system integrator is prohibited from disabling or modifying any configuration items related to the SECDED mechanisms of the Main CPU. The ECC (Error Correction Code) values for the flash locations that will be intentionally read by the Main CPU need to be programmed into the flash memory. These ECC values are generated and programmed during the flashing of the application with the TTC-Downloader."

The safety measures of the HY-TTC 500 platform do not check for stack overflows. The system integrator **shall** apply appropriate measures to check the stack, by means of e.g.:

- <chunk_seperator> The effective reaction time is based on the following parameters:
- The maximum cycle time (*t_cycle*) that is defined during the I/O driver initialization call
- The interval between the execution of the consistency check (*n_rounds_check*) in software cycles
- The external watchdog window time (*t_wd*) that is defined to be 64 ms. The calculation of the effective worst case failure reaction time is as follows: wc_frt = *max(t_cycle * (n_rounds_check + 1), t_wd)*
Compliance with the system's failure reaction time has been assumed during the HY-TTC 500 platform's FMEDA. Consequently, the effective diagnostic coverage for the relevant system components is only valid, if the application software's consistency checks are executed with an adequate frequency.

Question:  What actions must the application software take if the system's characteristics demand monitoring of corrected single bit errors in the Main CPU's internal memories?","If the system's characteristics demand monitoring of corrected single bit errors in the Main CPU's internal memories, the application software must take the following actions:

1. **Monitor Corrected Single Bit Errors**: The application software must continuously monitor the count of corrected single bit errors in the Main CPU's internal memories. This includes the internal Flash, configuration flash, and RAM memories.

2. **Use Specific Interfaces for Error Monitoring**: The application software should utilize the provided I/O driver interfaces to monitor the correctable error count for each type of memory:
   - For Flash memory: Use `DIAG_GetFlashErrors()`
   - For Configuration Flash memory: Use `DIAG_GetCfgFlashErrors()`
   - For RAM memory: Use `DIAG_GetRamB0Errors()` and `DIAG_GetRamB1Errors()`

3. **Adhere to Required Limits**: The application software must ensure that the count of corrected single bit errors remains within the required limits specified by the system's characteristics. This involves setting up thresholds or limits for the number of correctable single bit errors that can be tolerated.

4. **Activate Safe State on Limit Violation**: If the count of corrected single bit errors exceeds the predefined limits, the application software must activate the system's safe state. This is a critical safety measure to prevent potential system failures or unsafe conditions.

5. **Do Not Modify SECDED Mechanisms**: The system integrator must ensure that no configuration items related to the Single Error Correction Double Error Detection (SECDED) mechanisms of the Main CPU are disabled or modified. This ensures the integrity and reliability of the error correction and detection mechanisms.

By following these actions, the application software ensures that the system remains within safe operational parameters and can handle memory errors effectively, thereby maintaining the overall safety and reliability of the system."

Category: Comment ID: 717254 The following example outlines the procedure for calculating the worst case failure reaction time for a user application that utilizes redundant timer inputs with an assumed cycle time (*t_cycle*) of 10 ms and a consistency check for the redundant inputs that is executed every fourth application cycle 
(*n_rounds_check*).

-

-
The resulting worst case failure reaction time is: wc_frt = max(10 ms * (4 + 1), 64 ms) *= 64 ms* That means, the assumed diagnostic coverage for the timer input's safety mechanism (*redundancy*) is only valid for safety functions with a process safety time of 64 ms or higher. For those safety functions that require a shorter failure reaction time, the system integrator needs to either adapt the abovementioned parameters or provide separate diagnostic measures within the application software. <chunk_seperator> ## 7.15.2.405 #Define Io_Pwm_15 Io_Pin_178

Question:  What measures should the system integrator apply to check for stack overflows on the HY-TTC 500 platform?","To check for stack overflows on the HY-TTC 500 platform, the system integrator should apply the following measures:

1. **Periodic Check for a Preset Pattern at the End of the Stack**:
   - This involves placing a known pattern of data at the end of the stack memory. The system periodically checks this pattern to ensure it remains unchanged. If the pattern is altered, it indicates that the stack has overflowed into this region, signaling a stack overflow condition.

2. **Usage of the Memory Protection Unit (MPU)**:
   - The MPU can be configured to create a barrier at the end of the stack. This barrier prevents any write access beyond a certain point in the stack memory. If the stack pointer attempts to move past this barrier, the MPU will trigger an exception, thereby preventing a stack overflow from corrupting other memory regions.

These measures are essential because the safety measures of the HY-TTC 500 platform do not inherently check for stack overflows. Implementing these checks helps ensure the integrity and reliability of the system by preventing stack overflows, which can lead to unpredictable behavior and potential system failures."

Category: Comment ID: 723615 The HY-TTC 500 I/O driver provides 2 application callbacks, which can be configured when calling the general driver initialization function *IO_Driver_Init()*.

The callbacks are executed depending on the error type before the safe state is entered:
- Error callback - executed for *non-fatal* errors - Notification callback - executed for *fatal* errors Category: Comment ID: 723687 Within the error callback function, the application software can decide which action shall be taken (e.g. disable a PWM shut-off group).

Within the notification callback function, the application software could notify other controllers (e.g. in a CAN network), that a fatal error occurred and, if configured, a reset of the ECU will take place.

- <chunk_seperator> Category: Requirement Label: Error_Callback_Timing ID: 590305 Related To: 626937 Related To':
The application software's error callback function **shall** not introduce any significant delay when deciding the action to take, i.e. the error callback function must only contain basic statements for deciding which action to take. An acceptable upper limit for the execution of the callback function is 1 ms. This assures that the device's failure reaction time is not increased by the implementation of the callback function.

Category: Comment ID: 590311 The notification callback has no such limitation as the safe state is activated before this callback is called. It is still recommended to keep the notification callback function short because most interrupts 
(depending on the error) are disabled during its execution.
Question:  What measures does the HY-TTC 500 platform take to prevent inadvertent activation of the safe state due to glitches?","The HY-TTC 500 platform takes specific measures to prevent inadvertent activation of the safe state due to glitches originating from electromagnetic interference (EMI) or other disturbances. These measures include:

1. **Internal Diagnostic Measures for Glitch Filtering**: The platform filters glitches for its internal diagnostic measures. This filtering is designed to prevent the inadvertent activation of the safe state by ensuring that transient glitches do not trigger safety mechanisms unnecessarily.

2. **Application-Level Debouncing**: While the platform itself does not filter sensor values for the application, it is required that the application adequately debounce glitches for all safety-critical I/Os. This means that the application must implement its own mechanisms to handle and filter out glitches to ensure that only valid signals are processed, thereby preventing false activations of the safe state.

These measures ensure that the system remains robust against transient disturbances and only enters the safe state when genuinely required, thus maintaining the integrity and reliability of the safety-critical functions."

## 1.7.1 General

- The HY-TTC 500 System Manual is written for a specific product version, for example 02.00.

Make sure this document corresponds with the product version of the ECU. The *Product* Version **on the title page of this document must match the** *Version* **on the label of the ECU.**

The application **shall** adequately debounce glitches originating from EMI or other disturbances for all safety-critical I/Os. The HY-TTC 500 platform will only filter glitches for the platform's internal diagnostic measures to prevent inadvertent activation of the safe state, but will not filter the sensor values for the application.

Category: Requirement Label: Data_Protection ID: 717266 Related To: 631193,686246 Related To':
The application **shall** provide the appropriate protection for safety-critical data that is stored to the ECU's non-volatile memory (e.g. CRC protection or redundant data storage). <chunk_seperator> ## - - - - 5.5 Safe State - - 5.5.1 Application Callbacks

Category: Comment ID: 723615 The HY-TTC 500 I/O driver provides 2 application callbacks, which can be configured when calling the general driver initialization function *IO_Driver_Init()*.

The callbacks are executed depending on the error type before the safe state is entered:
- Error callback - executed for *non-fatal* errors - Notification callback - executed for *fatal* errors Category: Comment ID: 723687 Within the error callback function, the application software can decide which action shall be taken (e.g. disable a PWM shut-off group).

Within the notification callback function, the application software could notify other controllers (e.g. in a CAN network), that a fatal error occurred and, if configured, a reset of the ECU will take place.

The application software's error callback function **shall** not introduce any significant delay when deciding the action to take, i.e. the error callback function must only contain basic statements for deciding which action to take. An acceptable upper limit for the execution of the callback function is 1 ms. This assures that the device's failure reaction time is not increased by the implementation of the callback function.

Category: Comment ID: 590311 The notification callback has no such limitation as the safe state is activated before this callback is called. It is still recommended to keep the notification callback function short because most interrupts 
(depending on the error) are disabled during its execution.
Question:  How does the application ensure the protection of safety-critical data stored in the ECU's non-volatile memory?","The application ensures the protection of safety-critical data stored in the ECU's non-volatile memory by implementing appropriate data protection mechanisms. Specifically, the requirement labeled ""Data_Protection"" (ID: 717266) mandates that the application must provide suitable protection for such data. This can be achieved through methods such as CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) protection or redundant data storage.

CRC protection involves generating a checksum based on the data content and storing it alongside the data. When the data is read back, the checksum is recalculated and compared with the stored checksum to detect any discrepancies, indicating potential data corruption.

Redundant data storage involves storing multiple copies of the same data in different memory locations. This redundancy allows the system to cross-verify the data and recover from errors by using the correct copy if one becomes corrupted.

These measures are crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of safety-critical data, ensuring that the system can operate safely and effectively even in the presence of potential memory errors or corruption."

Category: Requirement Label: Error_Callback_Action ID: 723747 Related To: Related To':
If demanded by the system's design, the application software **shall** define an error callback function, returning an action for each failure of the safety-critical I/O's being part of a safety function.

Category: Requirement Label: Error_Callback_LS ID: 969456 Related To: Related To':
An error callback for a high side digital output or a PWM high side stage **shall** be treated with the same severity as an error on the corresponding low side safety switch. <chunk_seperator> Category: Requirement Label: Config_Data_Protection ID: 717494 Related To: 697105 Related To':
The application **shall** provide the appropriate protection for safety-critical configuration data that is located in the ECU's ""application configuration data"" memory region (e.g. CRC protection or redundant data storage). The HY-TTC 500 platform automatically performs board temperature monitoring during runtime with regards to the limits specified in the HY-TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM] and activates the safe state in case of range violations. This range check is not configurable, however, it can be extended by an additional check within the application software. <chunk_seperator> For safe operation of the HY-TTC 500 family ECUs, the following rules have to be obeyed:

## 1.7.1 General

- The HY-TTC 500 System Manual is written for a specific product version, for example 02.00.

Make sure this document corresponds with the product version of the ECU. The *Product* Version **on the title page of this document must match the** *Version* **on the label of the ECU.**
The following figure shows an example of an ECU label:

There are two main sections of text, one occupying most of the left side and another towards the right side. A small part of the paper is highlighted in red, possibly indicating an important detail or section. <chunk_seperator> - Systematic development process according to the requirements of the respective performance level
- Plausibility checks for allowing the detection of bit-modifications in critical memory areas - Usage of the Memory Protection Unit (MPU) to prevent bit-modifications in critical memory areas
Category: Requirement Label: IO_Deglitching ID: 717264 Related To: 320033 Related To':
The application **shall** adequately debounce glitches originating from EMI or other disturbances for all safety-critical I/Os. The HY-TTC 500 platform will only filter glitches for the platform's internal diagnostic measures to prevent inadvertent activation of the safe state, but will not filter the sensor values for the application.

Category: Requirement Label: Data_Protection ID: 717266 Related To: 631193,686246 Related To':
The application **shall** provide the appropriate protection for safety-critical data that is stored to the ECU's non-volatile memory (e.g. CRC protection or redundant data storage). <chunk_seperator> ## - - - - 5.5 Safe State - - 5.5.1 Application Callbacks

Category: Comment ID: 723615 The HY-TTC 500 I/O driver provides 2 application callbacks, which can be configured when calling the general driver initialization function *IO_Driver_Init()*.

The callbacks are executed depending on the error type before the safe state is entered:
- Error callback - executed for *non-fatal* errors - Notification callback - executed for *fatal* errors Category: Comment ID: 723687 Within the error callback function, the application software can decide which action shall be taken (e.g. disable a PWM shut-off group).

Within the notification callback function, the application software could notify other controllers (e.g. in a CAN network), that a fatal error occurred and, if configured, a reset of the ECU will take place.

- <chunk_seperator> Category: Requirement Label: Error_Callback_Timing ID: 590305 Related To: 626937 Related To':
The application software's error callback function **shall** not introduce any significant delay when deciding the action to take, i.e. the error callback function must only contain basic statements for deciding which action to take. An acceptable upper limit for the execution of the callback function is 1 ms. This assures that the device's failure reaction time is not increased by the implementation of the callback function.

Category: Comment ID: 590311 The notification callback has no such limitation as the safe state is activated before this callback is called. It is still recommended to keep the notification callback function short because most interrupts 
(depending on the error) are disabled during its execution.
Question:  How does the application software handle battery supply monitoring if stricter limits are required by the system's characteristics?","If the system's characteristics demand stricter limits for battery supply monitoring than those specified in the HY-TTC 500 System Manual, the application software must take additional measures to ensure compliance with these stricter requirements. Specifically, the application software is required to:

1. **Monitor the Battery Supply**: Implement monitoring of the battery supply according to the stricter limits required by the system's characteristics. This involves continuously checking the battery voltage to ensure it remains within the specified range.

2. **Activate the Safe State**: If the battery voltage falls outside the required limits, the application software must activate the safe state. This is a critical safety measure designed to prevent potential damage or unsafe conditions that could arise from inadequate battery supply.

The HY-TTC 500 platform provides basic battery voltage monitoring according to the limits specified in its system manual. However, if the application demands more stringent monitoring, the responsibility falls on the application software to implement this enhanced monitoring and ensure that the system transitions to a safe state when necessary. This ensures that the system remains reliable and safe even under conditions that exceed the standard specifications provided by the platform."

Question:  What is recommended if a newer Compiler version than V5.1.6 is used for the application interface?","If a newer Compiler version than V5.1.6 is used for the application interface, the following recommendations and requirements should be considered:

1. **Long-Term Support (LTS)**: The newer compiler version should be one that has long-term support (LTS) by Texas Instruments. This ensures that the compiler will receive updates and support for an extended period, which is crucial for maintaining the stability and reliability of the application software.

2. **API/ABI Compatibility Verification**: The system integrator must verify the API (Application Programming Interface) and ABI (Application Binary Interface) compatibility of the newer compiler version. This step is essential to ensure that the new compiler version does not introduce any incompatibilities that could affect the functioning of the application software.

3. **Additional Validation Steps**: The system integrator is required to perform additional validation steps that may be necessary when using a newer compiler version. This includes running test applications and conducting thorough testing to ensure that the new compiler version does not introduce any issues or bugs that could impact the application.

4. **Analysis of Known Bugs**: It is strongly recommended that the system integrator performs an analysis of the known bugs for the newer compiler version. This is important because some bugs that did not impact the I/O driver implementation might affect the implementation of the application. Therefore, a thorough review of the known issues is necessary to mitigate any potential risks.

By following these recommendations and requirements, the system integrator can ensure that the application software remains stable, reliable, and compatible with the newer compiler version."

Initialization of the UART module.

The UART module can only be initialized after IO_Driver_Init(). The function **IO_UART_Init()** needs to be called before any UART function. Parameters <chunk_seperator> wc_frt_io = wc_frt_io_timer = 100 ms The overall failure reaction time for this exemplary configuration of the HY-TTC 500 platform is therefore: wc_frt = wc_frt_core + wc_frt_io = 187 ms + 100 ms = 287 ms That means, the assumed diagnostic coverage for the I/O driver's core diagnostics is only valid for safety functions with a process safety time of 287 ms or higher. For those safety functions that require a shorter failure reaction time, the system integrator needs to either adapt the above-mentioned parameters or provide separate diagnostic measures within the application software. <chunk_seperator> -

The UART module can only be initialized after IO_Driver_Init(). The function **IO_UART_Init()** needs to be called before any UART function. Parameters <chunk_seperator> wc_frt_io = wc_frt_io_timer = 100 ms The overall failure reaction time for this exemplary configuration of the HY-TTC 500 platform is therefore: wc_frt = wc_frt_core + wc_frt_io = 187 ms + 100 ms = 287 ms That means, the assumed diagnostic coverage for the I/O driver's core diagnostics is only valid for safety functions with a process safety time of 287 ms or higher. For those safety functions that require a shorter failure reaction time, the system integrator needs to either adapt the above-mentioned parameters or provide separate diagnostic measures within the application software. <chunk_seperator> -

Initialization of the UART module.

The UART module can only be initialized after IO_Driver_Init(). The function **IO_UART_Init()** needs to be called before any UART function. Parameters <chunk_seperator> wc_frt_io = wc_frt_io_timer = 100 ms The overall failure reaction time for this exemplary configuration of the HY-TTC 500 platform is therefore: wc_frt = wc_frt_core + wc_frt_io = 187 ms + 100 ms = 287 ms That means, the assumed diagnostic coverage for the I/O driver's core diagnostics is only valid for safety functions with a process safety time of 287 ms or higher. For those safety functions that require a shorter failure reaction time, the system integrator needs to either adapt the above-mentioned parameters or provide separate diagnostic measures within the application software. <chunk_seperator> -

Category: Comment ID: 919710 Based on the specific failure modes of the HY-TTC 500 platform's hardware parts, a detailed FMEDA has been conducted. The following section lists the obtained MTTFd values for every functional block according to the two exemplary mission profiles (see section *Mission Profiles*). These values are also available as a dedicated library for usage within the SISTEMA software utility. 

The listed MTTFd values are directly related to the main connector's pins, regardless of their configured functions. That means, the dangerous failure rate does not change, if—for example—a dedicated output pin is configured to be used as an analog input, or a dedicated analog input is configured to be used as a digital input.

Category: Comment ID: 919710 Based on the specific failure modes of the HY-TTC 500 platform's hardware parts, a detailed FMEDA has been conducted. The following section lists the obtained MTTFd values for every functional block according to the two exemplary mission profiles (see section *Mission Profiles*). These values are also available as a dedicated library for usage within the SISTEMA software utility. 

The listed MTTFd values are directly related to the main connector's pins, regardless of their configured functions. That means, the dangerous failure rate does not change, if—for example—a dedicated output pin is configured to be used as an analog input, or a dedicated analog input is configured to be used as a digital input.

Category: Comment ID: 919710 Based on the specific failure modes of the HY-TTC 500 platform's hardware parts, a detailed FMEDA has been conducted. The following section lists the obtained MTTFd values for every functional block according to the two exemplary mission profiles (see section *Mission Profiles*). These values are also available as a dedicated library for usage within the SISTEMA software utility. 

The listed MTTFd values are directly related to the main connector's pins, regardless of their configured functions. That means, the dangerous failure rate does not change, if—for example—a dedicated output pin is configured to be used as an analog input, or a dedicated analog input is configured to be used as a digital input.

Category: Comment ID: 3276672 The following table covers all those functional blocks for which the HY-TTC 508 ECU does not provide any diagnostic measures. However, the system integrator may implement measures against dangerous failures on system level. To that end, every block's overall failure rate is assumed to be evenly distributed between safe and dangerous failures according to the general approach in ISO 13849, i.e. MTTFd = 2 * MTTF.
Question:  What is the significance of the item *Core* in the HY-TTC 500 platform?","The item *Core* in the HY-TTC 500 platform is of critical importance as it encompasses the platform's integral logic components, such as the internal power supply and the Main CPU. These components are essential for the general functioning of the Electronic Control Unit (ECU). The significance of the *Core* can be understood through several key points:

1. **Vital to ECU Functionality**: The *Core* is fundamental to the operation of the ECU. Without it, the ECU would not be able to perform its intended functions. This makes the *Core* indispensable for the overall system.

2. **Failure Rate Impact**: The failure rate of the *Core* must be considered in every individual safety function of the ECU. This means that regardless of which set of functional blocks is being utilized, the failure rate of the *Core* needs to be added to the failure rate of those blocks. This is crucial for accurate reliability and safety assessments.

3. **Integral Logic Components**: The *Core* includes critical components such as the internal power supply and the Main CPU. These components are responsible for the primary processing and power management within the ECU, making them central to the ECU's operation.

4. **Safety and Reliability Calculations**: The inclusion of the *Core*'s failure rate in safety function calculations ensures that the overall reliability and safety metrics of the ECU are comprehensive. This is particularly important for compliance with safety standards such as IEC 61508, which require detailed failure rate analysis.

5. **Transient Core Failures**: The *Core* also includes transient failures, such as soft errors in the Main CPU. These transient failures are typically considered in metrics calculations based on IEC 61508, highlighting the need to account for both permanent and transient failures in safety assessments.

In summary, the *Core* is a critical component of the HY-TTC 500 platform, essential for the ECU's functionality and central to the accurate calculation of safety and reliability metrics. Its failure rate must be included in the assessment of every safety function to ensure comprehensive safety and reliability evaluations."

Category: Comment ID: 3276672 The following table covers all those functional blocks for which the HY-TTC 508 ECU does not provide any diagnostic measures. However, the system integrator may implement measures against dangerous failures on system level. To that end, every block's overall failure rate is assumed to be evenly distributed between safe and dangerous failures according to the general approach in ISO 13849, i.e. MTTFd = 2 * MTTF.
Question:  How are transient core failures typically applicable in metrics calculations?","Transient core failures, which include the Main CPU's soft errors, are typically applicable in metrics calculations based on the IEC 61508 standard. IEC 61508 is an international standard for the functional safety of electrical, electronic, and programmable electronic safety-related systems. It provides a framework for ensuring that systems perform their intended safety functions under all stated conditions.

In the context of IEC 61508, transient core failures are considered because they can affect the reliability and safety of the system. These failures are often temporary and can be caused by various factors such as electromagnetic interference, cosmic rays, or other environmental conditions that induce soft errors in the Main CPU. 

The standard requires that these types of failures be accounted for in the overall safety assessment of the system. This involves calculating the failure rates and incorporating them into the safety metrics, such as the Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) and the Probability of Failure on Demand (PFD). By including transient core failures in these calculations, system designers can better understand the potential risks and implement appropriate diagnostic measures and fault-tolerant designs to mitigate them.

In summary, transient core failures are typically applicable in metrics calculations based on IEC 61508 because they impact the reliability and safety of the system, and the standard mandates their inclusion in the overall safety assessment to ensure comprehensive risk management."

Question:  What is the assumed distribution of failure rates for functional blocks without diagnostic measures in the HY-TTC 508 ECU?","For the HY-TTC 508 ECU, the assumed distribution of failure rates for functional blocks without diagnostic measures is evenly split between safe and dangerous failures. This approach follows the general methodology outlined in ISO 13849, where the Mean Time To Dangerous Failure (MTTFd) is calculated as twice the Mean Time To Failure (MTTF). This means that the overall failure rate is divided equally, with half of the failures considered safe and the other half considered dangerous."

Category: Comment ID: 3276672 The following table covers all those functional blocks for which the HY-TTC 508 ECU does not provide any diagnostic measures. However, the system integrator may implement measures against dangerous failures on system level. To that end, every block's overall failure rate is assumed to be evenly distributed between safe and dangerous failures according to the general approach in ISO 13849, i.e. MTTFd = 2 * MTTF.
Question:  What is the responsibility of the system integrator regarding diagnostic measures for the HY-TTC 510 ECU?","The system integrator has several key responsibilities regarding the diagnostic measures for the HY-TTC 510 ECU:

1. **Implementation of Diagnostic Measures**: The system integrator is responsible for implementing diagnostic measures to detect dangerous hardware failures for the functional blocks of the HY-TTC 510 ECU. This includes selecting appropriate diagnostic techniques and tools to ensure the safety and reliability of the system.

2. **Estimation of Diagnostic Coverage**: The system integrator must estimate the diagnostic coverage for each component. Diagnostic coverage refers to the effectiveness of the diagnostic measures in detecting potential failures. This estimation is crucial for ensuring that the implemented diagnostics are sufficient to meet safety requirements.

3. **Adherence to Guidelines**: While the document provides a guideline on the selection of diagnostic measures in the section *Failure Diagnostics*, it is the system integrator's responsibility to follow these guidelines and apply them appropriately to their specific system.

4. **Handling Functional Blocks Without Diagnostic Measures**: For functional blocks where the HY-TTC 510 ECU does not provide any diagnostic measures, the system integrator must implement measures against dangerous failures at the system level. This involves designing and integrating additional diagnostics to cover these blocks and ensure overall system safety.

5. **Failure Rate Assumptions**: The system integrator must assume that the overall failure rate for each block is evenly distributed between safe and dangerous failures, following the general approach in ISO 13849. This assumption is used to calculate the Mean Time To Dangerous Failure (MTTFd) and ensure that the system meets the required safety standards.

In summary, the system integrator plays a critical role in ensuring the safety and reliability of the HY-TTC 510 ECU by implementing and estimating the effectiveness of diagnostic measures, following provided guidelines, and addressing any gaps in diagnostics at the system level."

Some of these measures will be permanently enabled regardless of the application software, while others depend on the system integrator's implementation on system level. The following section will give a guideline on choosing an appropriate set of measures according to the desired value of diagnostic coverage for each individual functional block. In general, these measures are intended to detect hardware failures inside the HY-TTC 500 platform. Depending on the used components (i.e. switches, sensors or actuators), the measures might, however, also contribute to the detection of external failures. 

The selection of appropriate diagnostic measures requires the system integrator to regard the input elements' individual characteristics (i.e. possible signal ranges, failure modes, architectural parameters). <chunk_seperator> ## 6.5.4 Motor Classification 6.5.4.1 Independent From Speed Class

Question:  What is the responsibility of the system integrator regarding diagnostic measures and their coverage?","The system integrator is responsible for both the implementation of diagnostic measures and the determination of their diagnostic coverage. This involves selecting and applying appropriate diagnostic techniques to detect dangerous hardware failures in the system. The system integrator must estimate the diagnostic coverage for each component based on the implemented measures. Although the provided tables list the functional blocks and their respective failure rates, the specific diagnostic measures and their effectiveness are not detailed and must be determined by the system integrator. This responsibility includes ensuring that the diagnostic measures are adequate to meet the safety requirements of the system, as no detailed guidelines are provided for this process."

Question:  How are the failure rates for functional blocks without diagnostic measures assumed to be distributed according to ISO 13849?","For functional blocks without diagnostic measures, the failure rates are assumed to be evenly distributed between safe and dangerous failures according to the general approach in ISO 13849. This means that the Mean Time To Dangerous Failure (MTTFd) is calculated as twice the Mean Time To Failure (MTTF). This approach assumes that half of the failures are safe and the other half are dangerous, leading to the relationship MTTFd = 2 * MTTF."

Question:  What does the item ""Transient Core Failures"" include and to which metrics calculations is it typically applicable?","The item ""Transient Core Failures"" includes the Main CPU's soft errors. These types of failures are typically applicable to metrics calculations based on IEC 61508. Soft errors are temporary errors in the CPU that do not result from permanent hardware damage but rather from transient conditions such as cosmic rays or other environmental factors. These errors can affect the reliability and safety of the system, and their impact needs to be considered in safety-critical applications."

Question:  According to Note 1, what components are included in the item *Core* and why is its failure rate significant?","The item *Core* includes the integral logic components of the HY-TTC 500 platform, such as the internal power supply and the Main CPU. These components are essential to the Electronic Control Unit (ECU)'s general function. The significance of the failure rate of the *Core* lies in its critical role in the overall operation of the ECU. Since these components are vital for the ECU's functionality, any failure in the *Core* would impact every individual safety function that relies on the ECU. Therefore, the failure rate of the *Core* must be added to the failure rate of every individual safety function, regardless of the specific set of functional blocks being utilized. This ensures a comprehensive assessment of the overall reliability and safety of the system."

Question:  According to the context, what is the general approach in ISO 13849 for calculating MTTFd?","According to the context, the general approach in ISO 13849 for calculating MTTFd (Mean Time To Dangerous failure) is to assume that the overall failure rate of a block is evenly distributed between safe and dangerous failures. This means that the MTTFd is calculated as twice the Mean Time To Failure (MTTF). Therefore, the formula used is:

\[ \text{MTTFd} = 2 \times \text{MTTF} \]

This approach simplifies the estimation by assuming an equal distribution of failure modes between safe and dangerous categories."

The selection of appropriate diagnostic measures requires the system integrator to regard the input elements' individual characteristics (i.e. possible signal ranges, failure modes, architectural parameters).
Question:  What is the purpose of the diagnostic measures mentioned in the context?","The purpose of the diagnostic measures mentioned is to detect dangerous hardware failures within the HY-TTC 500 platform. These measures are designed to ensure the safety and reliability of the system by identifying potential failures that could compromise its operation. The diagnostic measures serve several key functions:

1. **Detection of Hardware Failures**: The primary goal is to identify hardware failures within the HY-TTC 500 platform. This includes failures in various components such as switches, sensors, and actuators.

2. **Permanent and Conditional Measures**: Some diagnostic measures are permanently enabled, regardless of the application software, ensuring a baseline level of safety. Others depend on the system integrator's implementation at the system level, allowing for customization based on specific needs and configurations.

3. **Guideline for Diagnostic Coverage**: The measures provide a guideline for selecting appropriate diagnostic coverage for each functional block. This helps system integrators choose the right set of measures to achieve the desired level of safety and reliability.

4. **Contribution to External Failure Detection**: While primarily focused on internal hardware failures, these measures can also help detect external failures, depending on the components used.

5. **System Integrator Responsibility**: The system integrator is responsible for performing a hazard and risk analysis for the overall system. They must select suitable measures against dangerous failures of individual components and determine the actual diagnostic coverage that can be claimed for each measure.

6. **Safety Performance Enhancement**: Implementing these diagnostic measures, regardless of the system's architectural demands, is recommended to achieve the best possible safety performance. This is especially important for systems that might permit the use of functional structures without diagnostic coverage.

7. **Combined Safety Mechanisms**: When safety mechanisms are combined, their diagnostic capabilities supplement each other, leading to higher overall diagnostic coverage. This principle is reflected in the slightly higher DC values suggested for combined safety mechanisms.

8. **Core Diagnostic Functions**: For the core of the HY-TTC 500 platform, diagnostic functions are executed during runtime if a safety configuration is passed to the general driver initialization function. This ensures that detected failures lead to a safe state and trigger the appropriate notification callback.

In summary, the diagnostic measures are essential for maintaining the safety and reliability of the HY-TTC 500 platform by detecting and responding to hardware failures, guiding system integrators in selecting appropriate safety measures, and enhancing overall system safety performance."

The following section will give a guideline on choosing an appropriate set of measures according to the desired value of diagnostic coverage for each individual functional block.

The selection of appropriate diagnostic measures requires the system integrator to regard the input elements' individual characteristics (i.e. possible signal ranges, failure modes, architectural parameters).
Question:  According to the context, what is required from the system integrator when selecting appropriate diagnostic measures?","When selecting appropriate diagnostic measures, the system integrator is required to:

1. **Consider Individual Characteristics**: Regard the input elements' individual characteristics, such as possible signal ranges, failure modes, and architectural parameters.

2. **Perform Hazard and Risk Analysis**: Conduct a thorough hazard and risk analysis for the overall system to identify potential dangers and assess the risks associated with hardware failures.

3. **Select Suitable Measures**: Choose appropriate measures against dangerous failures of individual components based on the hazard and risk analysis.

4. **Identify Actual Diagnostic Coverage**: Determine the actual diagnostic coverage that can be claimed for a specific diagnostic measure, ensuring it aligns with the system's safety requirements.

5. **Follow General Guidelines**: Use the provided list of diagnostic measures as a general guideline, understanding that it does not claim complete validity and must be adapted to the specific system context.

6. **Consider System Architecture**: Take into account the overall system architecture, which may permit the usage of functional structures without diagnostic coverage (e.g., for a system with a category B architecture according to ISO 13849). In such cases, it might be sufficient to rely on the function blocks' MTTFd values.

7. **Implement Failure Diagnostics**: Regardless of the system's architectural demands, TTControl suggests implementing an appropriate set of failure diagnostics to achieve the best possible safety performance.

By fulfilling these requirements, the system integrator ensures that the selected diagnostic measures are effective and appropriate for maintaining the safety and reliability of the HY-TTC 500 platform."

Question:  What happens if the application software passes a safety configuration to the general driver initialization function?","If the application software passes a safety configuration to the general driver initialization function, several important actions and outcomes occur:

1. **Implicit Execution of Diagnostic Functions**: The core's diagnostic functions are implicitly executed during runtime. This means that these diagnostic functions are automatically activated and cannot be disabled by the application software. This ensures that the core is continuously monitored for any potential failures.

2. **Average Diagnostic Coverage**: The diagnostic coverage for the core is determined as an average value based on several diagnostic measures. This implies that the system uses a comprehensive approach to monitor the core, taking into account multiple diagnostic mechanisms to ensure thorough coverage.

3. **Safe State Transition**: If any failures are detected within the HY-TTC 500 platform's core, the system will immediately transition to a safe state. This is a critical safety feature designed to prevent any hazardous situations that could arise from undetected failures.

4. **Notification Callback**: Along with transitioning to a safe state, the system will trigger the appropriate notification callback. This ensures that the system integrator or operator is informed about the detected failure and the transition to the safe state, allowing for timely intervention and troubleshooting.

5. **Reliability in Safe State Transfer**: For systems that require diagnostic coverage for one or more input or output stages (such as a category 2 subsystem), calling the general driver initialization function *IO_Driver_Init()* with a safety configuration is essential. This step is necessary to ensure that the HY-TTC 500 platform can reliably transfer the system to a safe state in the event of detected failures.

In summary, passing a safety configuration to the general driver initialization function ensures that the core's diagnostic functions are active, provides comprehensive diagnostic coverage, guarantees a safe state transition upon failure detection, and ensures reliable system behavior in maintaining safety."

Question:  How does combining safety mechanisms affect the overall diagnostic coverage according to the context?","Combining safety mechanisms that supplement each other in terms of their diagnostic capabilities results in an overall diagnostic coverage that is higher than the value of each individual mechanism. This principle is reflected in the table provided, which suggests slightly higher diagnostic coverage (DC) values for combined safety mechanisms. The rationale behind this approach is that when multiple safety mechanisms are used together, they can cover a broader range of potential failures and provide a more comprehensive diagnostic capability. This synergistic effect enhances the overall safety performance of the system by ensuring that more potential failure modes are detected and managed effectively. Therefore, the combined use of safety mechanisms is recommended to achieve a higher level of diagnostic coverage and, consequently, a higher level of system safety."

## 8.2.3 5 V Sensor Supplies <chunk_seperator> ## 8.2.3 5 V Sensor Supplies

Category: Comment ID: 920236 The 5 V sensor supplies' correct functioning is implicitly checked by the HY-TTC 500 platform's I/O driver, if at least one safety-critical analog input is allocated to the corresponding sensor supply. To that end, the analog feedback signal is permanently checked for its voltage level and the I/O driver triggers an error callback in case of deviations. If there is no safety-critical analog input assigned to a specific 5 V sensor supply, but the overall system design requires diagnostic measures for the supply output, the application software can still read and evaluate the measured voltage level by calling the appropriate task function *IO_ADC_Get()* with the corresponding sensor supply parameter. <chunk_seperator> Due to the sensor supply's nature of providing a steady, defined output voltage, the analog feedback measurement is considered a reliable safety mechanism with a high diagnostic coverage. Consequently, the assumed diagnostic coverage for the 5 V sensor suppy is 99%.

Question:  What are the different applications for the analog 3 mode inputs as described in section 8.2.4?","The analog 3 mode inputs can be utilized in a variety of fundamentally different applications. These applications include:

1. **Reading Simple Binary Switches**: This mode allows the system to detect the on/off state of binary switches, which are commonly used in various control and monitoring systems.

2. **Current Sensing Elements**: In this application, the analog inputs are used to measure the current flowing through a circuit. This is particularly useful in applications where monitoring the current is critical for safety or performance reasons.

3. **Ratiometric Output Voltages**: This mode involves measuring voltages that are proportional to a reference voltage. Ratiometric measurements are often used in sensor applications where the output voltage of the sensor varies in proportion to a supply voltage.

4. **Resistive Sensor Types**: The analog inputs can also be used to measure resistance, which is useful for sensors that change their resistance in response to physical changes such as temperature, pressure, or humidity.

While the voltage and current measurement modes allow for claiming a high diagnostic coverage even in a single channel configuration, the resistance measurement might require additional measures to achieve certain diagnostic coverage (DC) levels. This indicates that while voltage and current measurements are inherently reliable, resistance measurements may need supplementary diagnostic techniques to ensure the same level of reliability."

Question:  What might be required for resistance measurement to achieve certain diagnostic coverage levels according to section 8.2.4?","According to section 8.2.4, for resistance measurement to achieve certain diagnostic coverage (DC) levels, additional measures might be required. This is because, unlike voltage and current measurement modes, which can claim high diagnostic coverage even in a single-channel configuration, resistance measurement might not inherently provide the same level of diagnostic reliability. Therefore, implementing supplementary diagnostic measures would be necessary to ensure that the resistance measurement meets the desired DC levels. These additional measures could include redundant sensing, cross-checking with other sensor inputs, or implementing specific diagnostic algorithms to monitor the integrity and accuracy of the resistance measurements."

When using the voltage & current measurement modes, the analog 3 mode inputs' internal structure provides the HY-TTC 500 platform with the ability to internally diagnose hardware faults with a high diagnostic coverage. The I/O driver's diagnostic modules will trigger an error callback in case of a detected failure.

## Resistive Input:

Due to restrictions in the resistance measurement mode, the reference channel cannot be used to directly monitor the correct function of the analog input stage. Therefore, no implicitly executed safety mechanisms can be claimed by the system integrator for defining the input stages' diagnostic coverage values. Consequently, additional measures have to be implemented in the application software, if the overall safety function requires diagnostic coverage for the analog input stages.

When using the voltage & current measurement modes, the analog 3 mode inputs' internal structure provides the HY-TTC 500 platform with the ability to internally diagnose hardware faults with a high diagnostic coverage. The I/O driver's diagnostic modules will trigger an error callback in case of a detected failure.

## Resistive Input:

Due to restrictions in the resistance measurement mode, the reference channel cannot be used to directly monitor the correct function of the analog input stage. Therefore, no implicitly executed safety mechanisms can be claimed by the system integrator for defining the input stages' diagnostic coverage values. Consequently, additional measures have to be implemented in the application software, if the overall safety function requires diagnostic coverage for the analog input stages.

The I/O driver's diagnostic modules will trigger an error callback in case of a detected failure.

## Resistive Input:

Due to restrictions in the resistance measurement mode, the reference channel cannot be used to directly monitor the correct function of the analog input stage. Therefore, no implicitly executed safety mechanisms can be claimed by the system integrator for defining the input stages' diagnostic coverage values. Consequently, additional measures have to be implemented in the application software, if the overall safety function requires diagnostic coverage for the analog input stages.

Question:  What is the significance of the MTTFd values mentioned in the context?","The Mean Time to Dangerous Failure (MTTFd) values mentioned in the context are significant for several reasons:

1. **Reliability Assessment**: MTTFd values provide a quantitative measure of the reliability of a system or component. They indicate the average time until a dangerous failure occurs, which is critical for assessing the dependability of safety-related systems.

2. **Safety Standards Compliance**: The context references several safety standards, such as IEC 61508, ISO 13849-1, ISO 26262, and ISO 25119. These standards often require specific MTTFd values to ensure that systems meet certain safety integrity levels (SIL) or performance levels (PL). The MTTFd values help in demonstrating compliance with these standards.

3. **Functional Modes**: The MTTFd values are equally valid for all mentioned functional modes, which include voltage input, current input, resistive input, and digital input. This means that the reliability assessment applies uniformly across different types of input configurations, providing a consistent measure of safety.

4. **Single Channel Reflection**: For functional modes that require two input channels, the MTTFd value reflects the failure rate of a single channel. This is important for system designers to understand that the provided MTTFd value does not account for the combined reliability of both channels, and additional considerations may be necessary for dual-channel configurations.

5. **Diagnostic Coverage**: The context discusses the diagnostic coverage (DC) of various input modes. MTTFd values are closely related to diagnostic coverage because higher diagnostic coverage can lead to higher MTTFd values. For example, the voltage and current input modes have high diagnostic coverage due to internal diagnostic capabilities, which likely contribute to higher MTTFd values.

6. **Application Software Measures**: In cases where the hardware does not provide sufficient diagnostic coverage (e.g., resistive input mode), the MTTFd values indicate the need for additional measures in the application software to achieve the required safety function. This ensures that the overall system maintains a high level of safety despite hardware limitations.

7. **Redundancy and Safety Functions**: The context recommends redundant usage of independent input stages for safety functions that require a certain diagnostic coverage. The MTTFd values help in determining the necessity and effectiveness of such redundancy in achieving the desired safety levels.

In summary, the MTTFd values are crucial for evaluating the reliability and safety of the system, ensuring compliance with safety standards, and guiding the implementation of necessary safety measures in both hardware and software."

HYDACLAB® is a compact, multi-functional sensor for determining the online condition of oil. The user is kept informed of changes in fluid condition as they occur and can take immediate action in the case of deteriorating operating conditions.

driver's diagnostic modules will trigger an error callback upon detection of a signal range violation. In case of single-channel configuration of 3 mode analog inputs or utilization as resistive inputs, the application software has to implement such a diagnostic measure. This measure can, of course, only be applied to input stages with sensors that allow to define lower and upper limit values that still lie within the measurable ranges.

## 8.2.4.1 Redundancy

Category: Comment ID: 920872 The redundant usage of two analog inputs allows for continuous cross monitoring of the corresponding input signal. Plausibility checks within the application software permit the system integrator to detect a single fault in one of the input paths and transfer the overall system to a safe state. When defining the time interval of such checks, the system integrator needs to consider the overall system's failure reaction time. For details on calculating the worst case failure reaction times of such consistency checks, see section *Failure Diagnostics*. <chunk_seperator> Two independent sensor supplies 5 V for 3-wire sensors (e.g. **potentiometers, pressure sensors** etc.).

For fully redundant sensors with 2 sensor-supply connections, both supplies must be connected to different sensor supplies.

If the input voltage on the BAT+ CPU pin is lower than typically 6 V (at 5 mA sensor supply load current), the sensor supply output voltage will be out of specification. One example of such low input voltage situations may be cold-start cranking in 12/24 V systems where the supply voltage can drop below 6 V. If the sensor supply output voltage drops below 4.7 **V, the application software will be** informed about this error situation after glitch filtering.

TTControl GmbH recommends to use the maximum possible wire size (FLRY type) in case of maximum load current to reduce voltage drop and prevent overheating of the crimp contact.

See also section *POWER - Driver for ECU power functions* of the API documentation [30]. <chunk_seperator> Since this safety mechanism is able to detect only basic failure modes both internal and external to the HY-TTC 500 platform, the according diagnostic coverage is considered to be low, i.e. 60 %.

## 8.2.4.3 Internal Comparison Of Redundant Measurement Paths

Category: Comment ID: 544467 In order to check for short circuits to ground or battery voltage as well as open loads of dedicated inputs, a signal range check (SRC) can be utilized. That means a predefined margin on the upper and lower end of the measurable range is excluded from the sensor's valid output values. If for the signal range check a range of 5…95 % is configured to be valid for a sensor, all values below 5 % or above 95 % are considered erroneous by the I/O driver. <chunk_seperator> <table_277>[{'--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------': '--------------'}, {'IO_PWM_18 IO_PWM_18 IO_Pin.h 275 IO_PWM_19 IO_PWM_19 IO_Pin.h 275 IO_PWM_20 IO_PWM_20 IO_Pin.h 276 IO_PWM_21 IO_PWM_21 IO_Pin.h 276 IO_PWM_22 <chunk_seperator> Redundancy can also be claimed when combining two different input types (e.g. an analog input 3 mode with an analog input 2 mode for current measurement, or an analog 2 mode with a timer input for measuring digital signals), as long as the inputs' specifications both match the desired input signal).

This safety mechanism's diagnostic coverage is considered to lie between a value of **90-99** %, depending on the characteristics of the input elements (e.g. their possible failure modes) and the plausibility check's strictness.

## - 8.2.4.2 Signal Range Check -
Question:  What safety mechanisms might be required for connected input elements like switches or sensors to assure failure detection?","To assure failure detection in connected input elements such as switches or sensors, several safety mechanisms can be implemented. These mechanisms are selected based on the possible failure modes and the targeted failure rates. Here are some of the key safety mechanisms:

1. **Redundancy**:
   - **Dual Analog Inputs**: Using two analog inputs for the same signal allows for continuous cross-monitoring. Plausibility checks within the application software can detect a single fault in one of the input paths and transfer the system to a safe state. The time interval for these checks should consider the system's failure reaction time. This mechanism provides a diagnostic coverage of 90-99%, depending on the input elements' characteristics and the strictness of the plausibility checks.
   - **Combining Different Input Types**: Redundancy can also be achieved by combining different input types, such as an analog input 3 mode with an analog input 2 mode for current measurement, or an analog 2 mode with a timer input for digital signals. The inputs' specifications must match the desired input signal.

2. **Signal Range Check (SRC)**:
   - This mechanism checks for short circuits to ground or battery voltage and open loads by excluding a predefined margin on the upper and lower ends of the measurable range from the sensor's valid output values. For example, if a range of 5-95% is configured as valid, values below 5% or above 95% are considered erroneous.
   - The I/O driver periodically checks the measured values against these limits and triggers an error callback upon detecting a signal range violation. This mechanism is applicable to input stages with sensors that allow defining lower and upper limit values within the measurable ranges. The diagnostic coverage for this mechanism is considered low, around 60%.

3. **Internal Comparison of Redundant Measurement Paths**:
   - The internal structure of analog 3 mode inputs allows continuous monitoring of the analog input stages' correct operation. This is achieved through an independent reference channel that enables permanent plausibility checks of the measurement channel in voltage or current measurement modes.
   - Failures detected by the I/O driver's diagnostic modules trigger an error callback. This mechanism provides high diagnostic coverage (99%) for the internal input structure, though the coverage for failures within the sensor device may vary depending on the sensor's internal diagnostics and architecture.

4. **Analog 2 Mode Inputs**:
   - These inputs support ratiometric and absolute voltage measurements, as well as reading current sensors. Different diagnostic measures might be suitable depending on the utilized input elements.
   - Unlike the resistance measurement mode of analog 3 mode inputs, analog 2 mode inputs do not have internal reference channels to claim diagnostic coverage values without additional measures.

By implementing these safety mechanisms, system integrators can enhance the reliability and safety of the connected input elements, ensuring that potential failures are detected and managed appropriately."

Question:  How does the redundant usage of two analog inputs help in detecting faults in input paths?","The redundant usage of two analog inputs enhances fault detection in input paths through continuous cross-monitoring and plausibility checks. Here’s a detailed explanation of how this mechanism works:

1. **Continuous Cross-Monitoring**: By using two analog inputs to monitor the same signal, the system can continuously compare the readings from both inputs. This redundancy allows the system to detect discrepancies between the two input signals, which could indicate a fault in one of the input paths.

2. **Plausibility Checks**: The application software performs plausibility checks on the input signals. These checks involve comparing the readings from the two analog inputs to ensure they are consistent with each other. If a significant difference is detected, it suggests that one of the input paths may have a fault.

3. **Fault Detection and Safe State Transition**: When a fault is detected in one of the input paths through these plausibility checks, the system can take appropriate action to ensure safety. This typically involves transferring the overall system to a safe state to prevent any hazardous conditions that might arise from the faulty input.

4. **Time Interval Consideration**: The system integrator must define the time interval for these plausibility checks based on the overall system's failure reaction time. This ensures that faults are detected and addressed promptly, minimizing the risk of prolonged exposure to faulty conditions.

5. **Diagnostic Coverage**: The diagnostic coverage of this safety mechanism is considered to be between 90-99%, depending on the characteristics of the input elements and the strictness of the plausibility checks. This high level of diagnostic coverage indicates that the redundant usage of two analog inputs is highly effective in detecting faults.

6. **Combining Different Input Types**: Redundancy can also be achieved by combining two different input types, such as an analog input 3 mode with an analog input 2 mode for current measurement, or an analog 2 mode with a timer input for measuring digital signals. As long as the inputs' specifications match the desired input signal, this combination can also provide effective fault detection.

In summary, the redundant usage of two analog inputs helps in detecting faults in input paths by enabling continuous cross-monitoring, performing plausibility checks, and ensuring timely fault detection and safe state transitions. This mechanism provides a high level of diagnostic coverage, making it a reliable safety measure for input path fault detection."

HYDACLAB® is a compact, multi-functional sensor for determining the online condition of oil. The user is kept informed of changes in fluid condition as they occur and can take immediate action in the case of deteriorating operating conditions. Changes in fluid condition that might occur due to ageing or mixing with other fluids, for example, are indicated by measuring the temperature, the saturation level, the relative change in electrical conductivity and the relative change in dielectric constant (also referred to as DC). <chunk_seperator> In case the application software passes a safety configuration (i.e. defined signal ranges together with a redundant input channel) to the voltage/current input's initialization function, the measured values will be checked internally by the I/O driver for their upper and lower limits periodically during runtime and the I/O 
driver's diagnostic modules will trigger an error callback upon detection of a signal range violation. In case of single-channel configuration of 3 mode analog inputs or utilization as resistive inputs, the application software has to implement such a diagnostic measure. This measure can, of course, only be applied to input stages with sensors that allow to define lower and upper limit values that still lie within the measurable ranges.

Question:  What is the diagnostic coverage range for the redundancy safety mechanism, and what factors influence it?","The diagnostic coverage range for the redundancy safety mechanism is considered to lie between 90-99%. This range is influenced by several factors:

1. **Characteristics of the Input Elements**: The possible failure modes of the connected input elements (e.g., switches or sensors) play a significant role. Different input elements may have varying susceptibilities to faults, which can affect the overall diagnostic coverage.

2. **Plausibility Check's Strictness**: The thoroughness and rigor of the plausibility checks implemented within the application software are crucial. More stringent checks can detect faults more reliably, thereby increasing the diagnostic coverage.

3. **Combination of Input Types**: Redundancy can be achieved by using two analog inputs or by combining different input types (e.g., an analog input 3 mode with an analog input 2 mode for current measurement, or an analog 2 mode with a timer input for measuring digital signals). The compatibility and specifications of these inputs with the desired input signal also influence the diagnostic coverage.

4. **System Integrator's Configuration**: The system integrator's decisions regarding the time interval for consistency checks and the overall system's failure reaction time are also important. Proper configuration ensures timely detection and response to faults, contributing to higher diagnostic coverage.

These factors collectively determine the effectiveness of the redundancy safety mechanism in detecting and responding to faults, thereby influencing the diagnostic coverage range."

Question:  How does a signal range check (SRC) help in detecting short circuits, open loads, and what is its diagnostic coverage?","A signal range check (SRC) is a safety mechanism used to detect certain types of failures in input elements, such as short circuits to ground or battery voltage, and open loads. This is achieved by defining a valid range for the sensor's output values and excluding a predefined margin at both the upper and lower ends of the measurable range. For instance, if a valid range of 5% to 95% is configured for a sensor, any measured values below 5% or above 95% are considered erroneous.

The SRC works as follows:
1. **Short Circuits to Ground or Battery Voltage**: If a short circuit occurs, the sensor's output will likely fall outside the predefined valid range. For example, a short to ground might result in a value close to 0%, while a short to battery voltage might result in a value close to 100%. Both of these values would be outside the 5% to 95% valid range and thus be flagged as errors.
2. **Open Loads**: An open load condition might cause the sensor to output a value that is not within the expected operational range. This could be due to the sensor not being able to send any signal or sending a signal that is not within the valid range. Again, values outside the 5% to 95% range would be detected as erroneous.

The diagnostic coverage of the SRC is considered to be low, around 60%. This is because it can only detect basic failure modes and is limited to the input stages where the sensors allow for the definition of lower and upper limit values within the measurable ranges. The SRC does not provide comprehensive coverage for all possible failure modes, especially those that might occur internally within the sensor or the system beyond the simple range checks."

If for the signal range check a range of 5…95 % is configured to be valid for a sensor, all values below 5 % or above 95 % are considered erroneous by the I/O driver. <chunk_seperator> <table_277>[{'--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------': '--------------'}, {'IO_PWM_18 IO_PWM_18 IO_Pin.h 275 IO_PWM_19 IO_PWM_19 IO_Pin.h 275 IO_PWM_20 IO_PWM_20 IO_Pin.h 276 IO_PWM_21 IO_PWM_21 IO_Pin.h 276 IO_PWM_22 <chunk_seperator> Redundancy can also be claimed when combining two different input types (e.g. an analog input 3 mode with an analog input 2 mode for current measurement, or an analog 2 mode with a timer input for measuring digital signals), as long as the inputs' specifications both match the desired input signal).

This safety mechanism's diagnostic coverage is considered to lie between a value of **90-99** %, depending on the characteristics of the input elements (e.g. their possible failure modes) and the plausibility check's strictness.

Question:  What is the purpose of the internal comparison of redundant measurement paths in analog 3 mode inputs, and what is its diagnostic coverage for the internal input structure?","The purpose of the internal comparison of redundant measurement paths in analog 3 mode inputs is to continuously monitor the correct operation of the analog input stages. This is achieved through an independent reference channel that allows for permanent plausibility checks of the measurement channel when in voltage or current measurement modes. The I/O driver's diagnostic modules will detect any failures and trigger an appropriate error callback.

This safety measure is considered to provide a high diagnostic coverage for the internal input structure, specifically a coverage of 99%. However, the diagnostic capabilities for failures within the sensor device itself may vary depending on the specific sensor devices and their internal diagnostics and architectural category."

## - Voltage Input / Current Input:

Due to the analog 2 mode inputs' internal structure, internal diagnostics cannot realiably detect dangerous failures on their own. Even though a basic signal range check will be performed by the HYTTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules for redundantly configured analog inputs, additional measures might be required to achieve the overall safety function's diagnostic coverage for the analog input stages.

Digital Input: In the digital input configuration, certain failure modes of the analog input stages might not be detectable by the HY-TTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules. Hence, a redundant usage of independent input stages is recommended for safety functions that require a certain diagnostic coverage.

## - Voltage Input / Current Input:

Due to the analog 2 mode inputs' internal structure, internal diagnostics cannot realiably detect dangerous failures on their own. Even though a basic signal range check will be performed by the HYTTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules for redundantly configured analog inputs, additional measures might be required to achieve the overall safety function's diagnostic coverage for the analog input stages.

Digital Input: In the digital input configuration, certain failure modes of the analog input stages might not be detectable by the HY-TTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules. Hence, a redundant usage of independent input stages is recommended for safety functions that require a certain diagnostic coverage.

2. **NPN-type sensors**: These sensors have the switching element connected to the ground, and the output is pulled to the positive supply voltage when activated.
3. **Current loop sensors**: These sensors use a current loop to transmit the signal, which is often used in industrial environments for its robustness against electrical noise.

The load current is controlled with PWM. For better accuracy **and diagnostics, a current measurement/feedback loop is provided.**
If an error is detected in a safety-critical system, the watchdog or the main CPU can disable the output stage (off state), triggered by the application software. For diagnostic and safety reasons, the actual PWM output signal is looped back to a timer input, and the measured value is compared to the set value. For safety-critical applications, fast error detection is necessary. For this reason, a permanent PWM output is available, setting a minimum on/off time to 100/200 µ**s instead of 0 or 100 % duty cycle. This means, there is a reliable periodical state**

Question:  How does the redundant usage of two timer inputs contribute to system safety as described in the context?","The redundant usage of two timer inputs significantly enhances system safety by enabling continuous cross-monitoring of the corresponding input signal. This redundancy allows the system to perform plausibility checks within the application software, which are crucial for detecting single faults in one of the input paths. When a fault is detected, the system can then transfer to a safe state, thereby preventing potential hazards.

Here are the key contributions to system safety from the redundant usage of two timer inputs:

1. **Continuous Cross-Monitoring**: By using two timer inputs, the system can continuously monitor and compare the signals from both inputs. This cross-monitoring ensures that any discrepancies between the two signals can be quickly identified, indicating a potential fault in one of the input paths.

2. **Plausibility Checks**: The application software can implement plausibility checks to verify the consistency of the input signals. These checks help in detecting anomalies or faults in the input signals, which might not be detectable by the I/O driver's diagnostic modules alone.

3. **Fault Detection and Safe State Transition**: When a fault is detected in one of the input paths through cross-monitoring and plausibility checks, the system can transition to a safe state. This transition is crucial for maintaining the overall safety of the system, as it prevents the propagation of erroneous signals that could lead to unsafe conditions.

4. **Consideration of Failure Reaction Time**: The system integrator must define the time interval for these plausibility checks, taking into account the overall system's failure reaction time. This ensures that the system can respond promptly to detected faults, minimizing the risk of unsafe conditions.

5. **Diagnostic Coverage**: The diagnostic coverage of this safety mechanism is considered to be between 90-99%, depending on the characteristics of the input elements and the strictness of the plausibility checks. This high level of diagnostic coverage indicates a robust ability to detect and respond to faults, thereby enhancing the reliability and safety of the system.

6. **Combination with Different Input Types**: Redundancy can also be achieved by combining two different input types, such as a timer input's analog measurement with an analog input mode, or a timer input's digital measurement with an analog input mode for measuring static digital values. As long as the inputs' specifications match the desired input signal, this combination can provide additional safety benefits.

In summary, the redundant usage of two timer inputs contributes to system safety by enabling continuous monitoring, implementing plausibility checks, ensuring prompt fault detection and safe state transitions, and providing high diagnostic coverage. This redundancy is a critical safety mechanism that helps maintain the integrity and reliability of the system."

Category: Comment ID: 923493 In order to check for short circuits to ground or battery voltage as well as open loads of dedicated inputs, a frequency range check can be utilized. That means that predefined upper and lower limits for the measurement signals (in terms of frequency and pulse width) are defined. If for the signal range check a frequency range of 1 kHz…10 kHz is configured to be valid for a sensor, all values below 1 kHz or above 10 kHz are considered erroneous by the I/O driver.

For the timer input mode, the application software may pass a safety configuration (i.e. defined signal ranges) to the input's initialization function. The measured values will then be checked internally by the I/O drivers for their upper and lower limits periodically during runtime. This measure can, of course, only be applied to input stages with sensors that continuously generate output pulses even in their idle state. <chunk_seperator> Since this safety mechanism is able to detect only basic failure modes both internal and external to the HY-TTC 500 platform, the according diagnostic coverage is considered to be low, i.e. 60 %.

Category: Comment ID: 959614 In order to check for short circuits to ground or battery voltage as well as open loads of dedicated inputs, a signal range check (SRC) can be utilized. That means a predefined margin on the upper and lower end of the measurable range is excluded from the sensor's valid output values. If for the signal range check a range of 5…95 % is considered to be valid for a sensor, all values below 5 % or above 95 % can be considered erroneous. The application software might check the measured values for their upper and lower limits periodically during runtime and is able to initiate the safe state upon detection of a signal range violation.

Question:  What is the purpose of a frequency range check in the context of dedicated inputs?","The purpose of a frequency range check in the context of dedicated inputs is to detect and diagnose potential faults such as short circuits to ground or battery voltage, as well as open loads. This is achieved by defining predefined upper and lower limits for the measurement signals in terms of frequency and pulse width. For instance, if a frequency range of 1 kHz to 10 kHz is configured as valid for a sensor, any measured values falling below 1 kHz or exceeding 10 kHz are considered erroneous by the I/O driver.

In the timer input mode, the application software can pass a safety configuration, which includes these defined signal ranges, to the input's initialization function. The I/O drivers then periodically check the measured values against these upper and lower limits during runtime. This continuous monitoring helps in identifying and flagging any deviations from the expected frequency range, thereby ensuring the reliability and safety of the system.

However, this internal signal range check is not applicable for the analog input mode of the timer inputs. In such cases, it is the responsibility of the application software to implement a similar range check mechanism. The effectiveness of this safety measure in detecting various failure modes, both internal and external to the HY-TTC 500 platform, is considered to provide medium to high diagnostic coverage, ranging from 90% to 99%, depending on the extent of invalid measurement values that can be detected."

Category: Comment ID: 923493 In order to check for short circuits to ground or battery voltage as well as open loads of dedicated inputs, a frequency range check can be utilized. That means that predefined upper and lower limits for the measurement signals (in terms of frequency and pulse width) are defined. If for the signal range check a frequency range of 1 kHz…10 kHz is configured to be valid for a sensor, all values below 1 kHz or above 10 kHz are considered erroneous by the I/O driver.

For the timer input mode, the application software may pass a safety configuration (i.e. defined signal ranges) to the input's initialization function. The measured values will then be checked internally by the I/O drivers for their upper and lower limits periodically during runtime. This measure can, of course, only be applied to input stages with sensors that continuously generate output pulses even in their idle state. <chunk_seperator> Since this safety mechanism is able to detect only basic failure modes both internal and external to the HY-TTC 500 platform, the according diagnostic coverage is considered to be low, i.e. 60 %.

Category: Comment ID: 959614 In order to check for short circuits to ground or battery voltage as well as open loads of dedicated inputs, a signal range check (SRC) can be utilized. That means a predefined margin on the upper and lower end of the measurable range is excluded from the sensor's valid output values. If for the signal range check a range of 5…95 % is considered to be valid for a sensor, all values below 5 % or above 95 % can be considered erroneous. The application software might check the measured values for their upper and lower limits periodically during runtime and is able to initiate the safe state upon detection of a signal range violation. This measure can, of course, only be applied to input stages with sensors that allow to define lower and upper limit values that still lie within the measurable ranges. <chunk_seperator> The internal signal range check can, however, not be used for the analog input mode of the timer inputs. It is, therefore, in the responsibility of the application software to implement such a range check for the analog input mode. Since this safety mechanism is able to detect numerous failure modes both internal and external to the HY-TTC 500 platform, the according diagnostic coverage for the timer input mode is considered to be medium to high, i.e. **90-99** %, depending on the range of invalid measurement values.

Question:  What is the diagnostic coverage for the signal range check (SRC) and why is it considered low?","The diagnostic coverage for the signal range check (SRC) is considered to be low, specifically around 60%. This low diagnostic coverage is attributed to the fact that the SRC mechanism is only capable of detecting basic failure modes, both internal and external to the HY-TTC 500 platform. The SRC works by defining a valid range for sensor outputs, excluding a predefined margin on the upper and lower ends of the measurable range. For instance, if the valid range is set to 5% to 95%, any values below 5% or above 95% are considered erroneous. However, this method is limited in its ability to detect more complex or subtle failure modes, which reduces its overall effectiveness in ensuring system safety."

Specifically, these timer inputs are designed to measure signals from dedicated frequency sensors with various output characteristics (e.g., PNP-type, NPN-type, current loop). However, the inherent design constraints mean that they cannot be solely relied upon for safety-critical functions in measurement modes such as timer input, encoder input, or digital input.

To ensure safety in critical applications, additional safety measures must be implemented.

Category: Comment ID: 921278 The PWM high side stages allow operation of both resistive and inductive loads in a safety-critical manner. Due to the PWM control, they feature a continuous monitoring mechanism in the granularity of the PWM frequency. With internal safety switches being able to override a faulty power stage output, an independent secondary shut-off path is present to transfer the system to a safe state, in case of dangerous failures. <chunk_seperator> Note: For details about the implementation of these safety measures see the according chapters in the above section *Timer Inputs (IO_PWD_00 ... IO_PWD_05*).

## - Timer Input:

Due to their internal structure, the timer inputs 6-11 (*IO_PWD_06 ... IO_PWD_11*) in measurement mode timer input **must not** be utilized safety-critically on their own or in combination with another timer input from this group. They may be used, however, as secondary channels in a redundant architecture in combination with timer inputs 0-5 (*IO_PWD_00 ... IO_PWD_05*).

## Analog Input:

Similarly, the analog input measurement is not equipped with automatically enabled safety mechanisms. 

Therefore, no safety mechanisms can be claimed by the system integrator and additional measures have to be enabled, if the overall safety function requires diagnostic coverage for the analog input function.

In general PWM operation is not recommended as the PWM frequency for high efficient motors often require frequencies in excess of 10 kHz. A PWM frequency so high would cause lots of unacceptable electromagnetic noise (EMI) or dramatic switching losses or both. For small motors we can use a 200 Hz PWM instead. This causes a significant torque ripple which might be desirable for slow positioning of the motor with the need to prevent static friction.

As mentioned in section 6.5.3.9 **above, motors produce a back EMF when running. With PWM** controlled motors the motor is essentially free running between the PWM pulses. Depending on operating voltage and motor speed this back EMF can sometimes lead to false diagnostic errors.

## 6.5.3.11 Maximum Average Current (Pwm And Digital Power Stages)
Question:  What safety measures are feasible for the timer inputs 6-11 in measurement mode?","For the timer inputs 6-11 (*IO_PWD_06 ... IO_PWD_11*) in measurement mode, the following safety measures are feasible:

1. **Redundant Architecture**: Timer inputs 6-11 must not be utilized safety-critically on their own or in combination with another timer input from this group. However, they can be used as secondary channels in a redundant architecture. This means they can be paired with timer inputs 0-5 (*IO_PWD_00 ... IO_PWD_05*) to enhance safety through redundancy.

2. **Secondary Channels**: In a redundant system, timer inputs 6-11 can serve as secondary channels. This setup ensures that if one channel fails, the other can take over, thereby maintaining the safety integrity of the system.

These measures ensure that the timer inputs 6-11 contribute to the overall safety of the system when used in conjunction with other inputs, rather than being relied upon independently."

In general PWM operation is not recommended as the PWM frequency for high efficient motors often require frequencies in excess of 10 kHz. A PWM frequency so high would cause lots of unacceptable electromagnetic noise (EMI) or dramatic switching losses or both. For small motors we can use a 200 Hz PWM instead. This causes a significant torque ripple which might be desirable for slow positioning of the motor with the need to prevent static friction.

As mentioned in section 6.5.3.9 **above, motors produce a back EMF when running. With PWM** controlled motors the motor is essentially free running between the PWM pulses. Depending on operating voltage and motor speed this back EMF can sometimes lead to false diagnostic errors.

Question:  What additional measures are required for the analog input function to achieve diagnostic coverage?","To achieve diagnostic coverage for the analog input function, additional safety measures need to be enabled by the system integrator. The analog input measurement does not come with automatically enabled safety mechanisms, meaning that the system integrator cannot claim any inherent safety mechanisms for this function. Therefore, to ensure the overall safety function and achieve the necessary diagnostic coverage, the following measures should be considered:

1. **Input Comparison/Voting**: Implementing input comparison or voting mechanisms as outlined in standards such as IEC 61508-7, ISO 13849-1 Table E.1, ISO 26262-5 Table D.5, and ISO 25119-2 Table C.6. These mechanisms involve comparing the input signals from multiple sources to detect discrepancies and ensure the reliability of the input data.

2. **Plausibility Check**: Conducting plausibility checks to verify that the input signals are within expected ranges and behave as anticipated under normal operating conditions. This helps in identifying any anomalies or faults in the input signals.

3. **Monitoring Characteristics**: Monitoring specific characteristics of the analog input signals, such as signal range, to ensure they remain within predefined limits. This can help in detecting any deviations that might indicate a fault.

4. **Redundancy**: Utilizing redundant input channels to provide a backup in case one channel fails. This redundancy can be achieved by using multiple analog inputs and comparing their outputs to ensure consistency and reliability.

By implementing these additional measures, the system integrator can enhance the diagnostic coverage of the analog input function, thereby contributing to the overall safety and reliability of the system."

Question:  How can timer inputs 6-11 be used in a redundant architecture for digital input measurement mode?","Timer inputs 6-11 (*IO_PWD_06 ... IO_PWD_11*) in measurement mode digital input cannot be used safety-critically on their own or in combination with another timer input from the same group due to their internal structure. However, they can be utilized as secondary channels in a redundant architecture. This means that while they cannot be the primary safety-critical inputs, they can serve as backup or supplementary channels to enhance the overall safety of the system.

In a redundant architecture for digital input measurement mode, timer inputs 6-11 can be combined with other types of inputs to ensure safety. Specifically, they can be used in conjunction with:

1. **Dedicated Analog Inputs**: These are inputs specifically designed for analog signals and can provide a primary channel for safety-critical measurements.
2. **Timer Inputs 0-5**: These timer inputs (*IO_PWD_00 ... IO_PWD_05*) are suitable for safety-critical applications and can serve as the primary channels.
3. **Dedicated Digital Outputs**: These outputs are designed for digital signals and can be used to create a redundant path for safety-critical operations.
4. **PVG Outputs**: These outputs (*IO_PVG_00 ... IO_PVG_07*) are another type of output that can be used in a redundant architecture to ensure safety.

By combining timer inputs 6-11 with these other inputs, the system can achieve a higher level of diagnostic coverage and safety. The redundancy ensures that if one input fails, the other can take over, thereby maintaining the integrity and safety of the system."

2. **Internal Safety Switches**: These stages are equipped with internal safety switches that can override a faulty power stage output. This capability is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the system by preventing the propagation of faults.

3. **Independent Secondary Shut-off Path**: In the event of dangerous failures, the PWM high side stages have an independent secondary shut-off path. This path is designed to transfer the system to a safe state, thereby mitigating the risk of hazardous conditions.

In general PWM operation is not recommended as the PWM frequency for high efficient motors often require frequencies in excess of 10 kHz. A PWM frequency so high would cause lots of unacceptable electromagnetic noise (EMI) or dramatic switching losses or both. For small motors we can use a 200 Hz PWM instead. This causes a significant torque ripple which might be desirable for slow positioning of the motor with the need to prevent static friction.

As mentioned in section 6.5.3.9 **above, motors produce a back EMF when running. With PWM** controlled motors the motor is essentially free running between the PWM pulses. Depending on operating voltage and motor speed this back EMF can sometimes lead to false diagnostic errors.

## 6.5.3.11 Maximum Average Current (Pwm And Digital Power Stages)
Question:  What safety mechanisms are automatically enabled for analog input measurements?","For analog input measurements, there are no automatically enabled safety mechanisms. The system integrator cannot claim any inherent safety mechanisms for the analog input function. If the overall safety function requires diagnostic coverage for the analog input, additional measures must be enabled manually."

## Hs Pwm Output:

The I/O driver's diagnostic module continuously compares the desired output duty cycle and frequency with the feedback measurements, thus allowing to reliably detect failures within the PWM output stages. This measure is active for every PWM high side output that is initialized as safety-critical and will trigger an error callback in case of dangerous failures. Due to their superior diagnostic capabilities, the system integrator is advised to use the PWM output mode rather than the digital output mode for safety-critical applications, even if the corresponding actuators are only operated statically. This can be achieved by implementing a pseude-digital mode, that only changes between minimum and maximum output duty cycles.

## Hs Pwm Output:
Question:  What is the recommended mode for safety-critical applications according to the context, and why?","The recommended mode for safety-critical applications is the **HS PWM Output** mode. This recommendation is based on several key factors:

1. **Continuous Diagnostic Monitoring**: The I/O driver's diagnostic module in the HS PWM Output mode continuously compares the desired output duty cycle and frequency with the feedback measurements. This continuous monitoring allows for the reliable detection of failures within the PWM output stages.

2. **Error Callback Mechanism**: The system is designed to trigger an error callback in case of dangerous failures. This proactive error detection and reporting mechanism enhances the overall safety of the system.

3. **Superior Diagnostic Capabilities**: The HS PWM Output mode is noted for its superior diagnostic capabilities compared to the digital output mode. This makes it more suitable for applications where safety is critical.

4. **Flexibility in Implementation**: Even if the corresponding actuators are only operated statically, the system integrator can implement a pseudo-digital mode that only changes between minimum and maximum output duty cycles. This flexibility ensures that the safety benefits of the HS PWM Output mode can be leveraged even in applications that do not require dynamic operation.

5. **Compliance with Safety Standards**: The HS PWM Output mode adheres to various safety standards such as IEC 61508-7 A.2.2 - Dynamic principles, which further validates its suitability for safety-critical applications.

In summary, the HS PWM Output mode is recommended for safety-critical applications due to its continuous diagnostic monitoring, error callback mechanism, superior diagnostic capabilities, flexibility in implementation, and compliance with safety standards."

Question:  What additional information is provided about the HS PWM Current Measurement mode in relation to the HS PWM Output mode?","The HS PWM Current Measurement mode provides additional information that is crucial for safety-critical applications. Specifically, it is mentioned that the metrics of the HS PWM Current Measurement mode need to be added to the metrics of the HS PWM Output mode if the current measurement is considered safety-critical in the overall system. This implies that the current measurement functionality is integrated with the PWM output and enhances the overall safety diagnostics by providing additional monitoring capabilities.

Furthermore, it is noted that the HS PWM Current Measurement mode does not require an additional connector pin, as it bases its measurement on the corresponding HS PWM output pin. This integration simplifies the hardware design and ensures that the current measurement can be seamlessly incorporated into the existing PWM output infrastructure without the need for additional physical connections.

In summary, the HS PWM Current Measurement mode complements the HS PWM Output mode by providing enhanced safety diagnostics through integrated current measurement, which is essential for safety-critical applications. This integration is achieved without the need for additional hardware, thereby streamlining the system design."

Due to their internal structure, the PWM ouput stages in measurement mode digital input **must not** be utilized safety-critically on their own or in combination with another input from this group. They may be used, however, as secondary channels in a redundant architecture in combination with dedicated analog inputs, timer inputs 0-5, dedicated digital outputs or PVG outputs (*IO_ADC_00 ... IO_ADC_23,* IO_PWD_00 ... IO_PWD_05, IO_DO_00 ... IO_DO_15 or IO_PVG_00 ... IO_PVG_07).

## 8.2.8.1 Plausibility Check <chunk_seperator> Depending on the plausibility check's strictness, diagnostic coverage values between 90 % and 99 % are considered feasible.

## 8.2.8.2 Status Monitoring

Category: Comment ID: 923591 The digital state of the PWM high side outputs can be read via the static feedback signals. That way, the application software is able to verify the correct function of the digital high side outputs and activate the safe state in case of dangerous failures. The additional internal safety switches constitute a secondary shut-off path that can de-energize the actuators independently from the PWM power stages. This safety mechanism allows to detect a substantial amount of possible hardware failures and is therefore considered to yield a DC value of 90 %.

## 8.2.8.3 Shut-Off Path Test - - <chunk_seperator> 12 digital inputs with timer function to process input signals such as frequency (rotational speed), pulse count and quadrature decoding (incremental length measurement), PWM etc. 6 out of 12 inputs can be alternatively used as digital (7/14 mA) current loop speed sensors. The inputs can be individually configured by software with a pull-up/pull-down resistor to adapt them to different sensor types, The timer input can be used as an analog voltage input as well. **For diagnosis, it is possible to** measure the analog voltage and frequency at the same channel **at the same time.** See also sections *PWD - Pulse Width Decode and digital timer input driver* and *DIO - Driver for* digital inputs and outputs **of the API documentation [30].**

## 4.11.3 Maximum Ratings

Category: Comment ID: 592163 The digital timer inputs 0-5 (*IO_PWD_00* ... *IO_PWD_05*) provide the necessary diagnostic measures and are usable for safety-critical applications, when adhering to the requirements in the following section. The digital timer inputs 6-11 (*IO_PWD_06* ... *IO_PWD_11*) do not provide the same set of diagnostic measures and are therefore not usable for safety-critical applications without further restrictions. For details about their suitability, please refer to section *Guideline on Hardware Metrics Determination*. <chunk_seperator> ## 8.2.8.4 Redundancy

Category: Comment ID: 921253 The redundant usage of independent digital inputs allows for continuous cross monitoring of the corresponding input signal. Plausibility checks within the application software permit the system integrator to detect a single fault in one of the input paths and transfer the overall system to a safe state. When defining the time interval of such checks, the system integrator needs to consider the overall system's failure reaction time. For details on calculating the worst case failure reaction times of such consistency checks, see section *Failure Diagnostics*.

Redundancy can also be claimed when combining two different input types (e.g. a PWM stage's digital input measurement with an timer input, or a PWM stage's digital input measurement with the digital sampling of an analog input 3 mode), as long as the inputs' specifications both match the desired input signal. <chunk_seperator> ## - 8.2.11.2 Shut-Off Path Test - -

Category: Comment ID: 964502 In order to check the proper operation of the secondary shut-off path, its ability to transfer the system into a safe state needs to be tested in certain intervals, e.g. at the beginning of each driving cycle or during pre-defined maintenance activities. That way, the system can be considered to offer a valid category 2 architecture, according to ISO 13849.

## 8.2.11.3 Redundancy <chunk_seperator> This safety mechanism's diagnostic coverage is considered to lie between a value of **90-99** %, depending on the characteristics of the input elements (e.g. their possible failure modes) and the plausibility check's strictness.

Category: Comment ID: 1194918 In order to check the proper operation of the secondary shut-off path, its ability to transfer the system into a safe state needs to be tested in certain intervals, e.g. at the beginning of each driving cycle or during pre-defined maintenance activities. That way, the system can be considered to offer a valid category 2 architecture, according to ISO 13849.

In case the PWM output stages current measurement is also defined as safety-critical, the I/O driver's diagnostic module provides an implicitly executed range check that is able to detect basic failures within the current measurement path of the output stage. When detecting such failures, the I/O driver's diagnostic module will trigger an error callback. If the system integrator requires higher DC values, the implementation of additional measures (e.g. plausibility checks of the measured current values) within the application software is required.

## - - - Hs Digital Output:

If explicitly configured as digital outputs, the PWM high side stages will be operated statically and will not make use of any PWM signals. The state of such digital outputs will not be automatically monitored by the I/O driver's diagnostic modules. An according plausibility check of the digital feedback value needs to be implemented by the system integrator.

Category: Comment ID: 923888 The integrity of the measured PWM output current can be checked by performing dedicated plausibility checks with independent measurement signals. That could be, for example, the direct comparison to an independent current sensor or the evaluation of the controlled actuators' physical state (with position or speed sensors). Another practical plausibility check for the safety-critical current measurement would be to check the actual current measurement value against an expected current, based on the PWM output's duty cycle and the actuator's resistive characteristics.

Depending on the plausibility check's strictness, diagnostic coverage values between 90 % and 99 % are considered feasible.

## 8.2.8.2 Status Monitoring
Question:  How should the system integrator handle the monitoring of digital outputs configured from PWM high side stages?","When the PWM high side stages are configured as digital outputs, the system integrator must take specific steps to ensure proper monitoring and safety. Here are the detailed steps and considerations:

1. **Static Operation**: The PWM high side stages, when configured as digital outputs, will operate statically without utilizing PWM signals. This means they will maintain a constant state rather than varying their output.

2. **Plausibility Check Implementation**: The I/O driver's diagnostic modules do not automatically monitor the state of these digital outputs. Therefore, the system integrator must implement a plausibility check for the digital feedback value. This involves verifying that the feedback signal corresponds correctly to the expected output state.

3. **Status Monitoring**: The digital state of the PWM high side outputs can be read via static feedback signals. The application software should use these feedback signals to verify the correct function of the digital high side outputs. This verification process helps ensure that the outputs are operating as intended and can detect any discrepancies that might indicate a failure.

4. **Activation of Safe State**: In case of detecting dangerous failures through the feedback signals, the application software should be capable of activating a safe state. This involves de-energizing the actuators or taking other necessary actions to mitigate the risk posed by the failure.

5. **Secondary Shut-Off Path**: The system features additional internal safety switches that act as a secondary shut-off path. These switches can de-energize the actuators independently from the PWM power stages. This mechanism is crucial for detecting and responding to hardware failures, providing an additional layer of safety.

6. **Diagnostic Coverage**: The combination of static feedback signal monitoring and the secondary shut-off path is considered to yield a diagnostic coverage (DC) value of 90%. This means that the system can detect and respond to a substantial amount of possible hardware failures, ensuring a high level of safety.

7. **Regular Testing**: To ensure the proper operation of the secondary shut-off path, it should be tested at regular intervals. This could be at the beginning of each driving cycle or during predefined maintenance activities. Regular testing helps confirm that the system can reliably transfer to a safe state when necessary.

By following these steps, the system integrator can effectively monitor and ensure the safety of digital outputs configured from PWM high side stages, maintaining the integrity and reliability of the overall system."

Question:  Why must digital inputs in measurement mode not be used safety-critically on their own or in combination with another input from the same group?","Digital inputs in measurement mode must not be used safety-critically on their own or in combination with another input from the same group due to their internal structure. This internal structure likely introduces limitations or vulnerabilities that could compromise the reliability and safety of the system if these inputs were used in a safety-critical capacity without additional safeguards. 

However, these digital inputs can be used as secondary channels in a redundant architecture. This means they can complement other more reliable inputs, such as dedicated analog inputs, timer inputs, dedicated digital outputs, or PVG outputs. By doing so, the system can achieve a higher level of safety through redundancy, where the digital inputs serve as backup channels that can cross-monitor the primary inputs. This redundancy allows for the detection of single faults in one of the input paths and enables the system to transfer to a safe state if a fault is detected.

The redundancy and cross-monitoring mechanisms, along with plausibility checks within the application software, ensure that the overall system maintains its safety integrity. This approach leverages the strengths of different input types and mitigates the weaknesses of using digital inputs in measurement mode alone for safety-critical applications."

Category: Comment ID: 923888 The integrity of the measured PWM output current can be checked by performing dedicated plausibility checks with independent measurement signals. That could be, for example, the direct comparison to an independent current sensor or the evaluation of the controlled actuators' physical state (with position or speed sensors). Another practical plausibility check for the safety-critical current measurement would be to check the actual current measurement value against an expected current, based on the PWM output's duty cycle and the actuator's resistive characteristics.

Depending on the plausibility check's strictness, diagnostic coverage values between 90 % and 99 % are considered feasible.

## 8.2.8.2 Status Monitoring
Question:  What is the purpose of performing plausibility checks on the measured PWM output current, and what diagnostic coverage values are considered feasible?","The purpose of performing plausibility checks on the measured PWM output current is to ensure the integrity and reliability of the current measurement, which is critical for the safe operation of the system. These checks help detect discrepancies or failures in the current measurement path by comparing the measured current against independent measurement signals or expected values. This can be done through various methods, such as:

1. **Direct Comparison**: Comparing the measured current to an independent current sensor.
2. **Evaluation of Actuator's Physical State**: Assessing the physical state of the controlled actuators using position or speed sensors.
3. **Expected Current Comparison**: Checking the actual current measurement value against an expected current based on the PWM output's duty cycle and the actuator's resistive characteristics.

By implementing these plausibility checks, the system can identify and respond to potential failures, thereby enhancing the overall safety and reliability of the PWM output stages.

The diagnostic coverage values for these plausibility checks are considered to be between 90% and 99%, depending on the strictness and thoroughness of the checks performed. This range indicates a high level of confidence in the system's ability to detect and handle failures effectively, contributing to the safety-critical nature of the application."

The digital timer inputs 6-11 (*IO_PWD_06* ... *IO_PWD_11*) do not provide the same set of diagnostic measures and are therefore not usable for safety-critical applications without further restrictions. For details about their suitability, please refer to section *Guideline on Hardware Metrics Determination*. <chunk_seperator> ## 8.2.8.4 Redundancy

Category: Comment ID: 921253 The redundant usage of independent digital inputs allows for continuous cross monitoring of the corresponding input signal. Plausibility checks within the application software permit the system integrator to detect a single fault in one of the input paths and transfer the overall system to a safe state. When defining the time interval of such checks, the system integrator needs to consider the overall system's failure reaction time. For details on calculating the worst case failure reaction times of such consistency checks, see section *Failure Diagnostics*.

Redundancy can also be claimed when combining two different input types (e.g. a PWM stage's digital input measurement with an timer input, or a PWM stage's digital input measurement with the digital sampling of an analog input 3 mode), as long as the inputs' specifications both match the desired input signal. <chunk_seperator> ## - 8.2.11.2 Shut-Off Path Test - -

## 8.2.8.2 Status Monitoring
Question:  How do the digital high side stages ensure safety-critical operation and what mechanism is used to transfer the system into a safe state in case of dangerous failures?","The digital high side stages ensure safety-critical operation through several mechanisms designed to monitor and control the system effectively. Here are the key aspects:

1. **Internal Feedback Mechanisms**: The digital high side stages are equipped with internal feedback mechanisms that continuously monitor the effective output voltage. This continuous monitoring helps in detecting any anomalies or dangerous failures in real-time.

2. **Secondary Shut-Off Paths**: In case of dangerous failures, the system employs assigned low side outputs as secondary shut-off paths. These low side outputs can de-energize the actuators independently from the PWM power stages, ensuring that the system can be transferred into a safe state even if the primary control path fails.

3. **Static Feedback Signals**: The digital state of the PWM high side outputs can be read via static feedback signals. This allows the application software to verify the correct function of the digital high side outputs. If a dangerous failure is detected, the software can activate the safe state.

4. **Additional Internal Safety Switches**: These switches provide a secondary shut-off path that can de-energize the actuators independently from the PWM power stages. This mechanism is crucial for detecting a substantial amount of possible hardware failures and contributes to a diagnostic coverage (DC) value of 90%.

5. **Plausibility Checks**: The system integrator can implement plausibility checks within the application software to verify the integrity of the measured PWM output current. These checks can involve comparing the measured current to an independent current sensor or evaluating the controlled actuators' physical state using position or speed sensors. Such checks help in ensuring that the system operates within safe parameters.

6. **Redundancy**: The system allows for the redundant usage of independent digital inputs, enabling continuous cross-monitoring of the corresponding input signal. This redundancy helps in detecting single faults in one of the input paths and transferring the overall system to a safe state.

By combining these mechanisms, the digital high side stages ensure that the system can operate safely and can be transferred into a safe state in case of dangerous failures. The use of internal feedback, secondary shut-off paths, static feedback signals, additional safety switches, plausibility checks, and redundancy all contribute to the robust safety-critical operation of the system."

Question:  What safety measures are recommended for the analog input function of the digital high side stages?","For the analog input function of the digital high side stages, the system integrator cannot rely on automatically enabled safety mechanisms, as these are not equipped with such features. Therefore, it is recommended that additional safety measures be enabled if the overall safety function requires diagnostic coverage for the analog input function. This means that the system integrator must implement extra diagnostic measures to ensure the safety and reliability of the analog input function, as the built-in mechanisms of the digital high side stages do not provide sufficient safety coverage on their own."

Question:  What is the purpose of voltage monitoring in the context of digital high side outputs?","The purpose of voltage monitoring in the context of digital high side outputs is to ensure the correct functioning of these outputs and to detect any dangerous failures. The current state of the digital high side outputs can be read via static voltage feedback signals, which allows the application software to verify their correct operation. If a dangerous failure is detected, the system can activate a safe state to prevent any hazardous situations.

Specifically, voltage monitoring helps in the following ways:

1. **Verification of Correct Function**: By reading the static voltage feedback signals, the application software can confirm that the digital high side outputs are functioning as intended. This continuous verification process is crucial for maintaining the reliability and safety of the system.

2. **Detection of Dangerous Failures**: If the voltage feedback indicates a discrepancy between the desired output status and the actual state, it can signal a dangerous failure. This discrepancy triggers an error callback, allowing the system to take corrective actions.

3. **Activation of Safe State**: In case of a detected dangerous failure, the system can activate a safe state to mitigate any potential hazards. This might involve shutting down certain operations or activating emergency mechanisms to ensure safety.

4. **Redundancy and Safety Measures**: If independent digital low side outputs are not used as secondary shut-off paths, the system integrator must provide alternative means to ensure safety. This could include using a separate emergency valve to disrupt hydraulic oil flow and stop dangerous movements, thereby bringing the system to a safe state.

Overall, voltage monitoring is a critical safety measure that helps in maintaining the integrity and safety of digital high side outputs by providing real-time feedback and enabling prompt responses to any detected failures."

Category: Comment ID: 894468 The redundant usage of independent inputs allows for continuous cross monitoring of the corresponding input signal. Plausibility checks within the application software permit the system integrator to detect a single fault in one of the input paths and transfer the overall system to a safe state. When defining the time interval of such checks, the system integrator needs to consider the overall system's failure reaction time. For details on calculating the worst case failure reaction times of such consistency checks, see section *Failure Diagnostics*.

Redundancy can also be claimed when combining two different input types (e.g. a digital output stage's analog input measurement with an analog input 3 mode, or a digital output stage's digital input measurement with a timer input), as long as the inputs' specifications both match the desired input signal. <chunk_seperator> In PVG mode, PVG valves have a well-defined input resistance, **and the output signal settings can** be calculated in advance by considering the characteristics of the output stage. In voltage mode, however, a PID controller must be applied to generate the desired output voltage.

The VOUT **mode output can be used to control PVG valves of the type PVEU or other generic resistive**
loads.

For diagnostic reasons, the output signal is looped back to the CPU in output mode, and the measured value is compared to the set value. If the difference between these two values is above a fixed limit, an overload is detected and the output is disabled. The protection mechanism tries to reenable the output 10 times per drive cycle.

Question:  What is the valid signal range for a sensor when performing a signal range check to detect short circuits or open loads?","The valid signal range for a sensor when performing a signal range check to detect short circuits to ground or battery voltage, as well as open loads, is 5% to 95%. This means that any sensor output values below 5% or above 95% should be considered erroneous by the application software."

## 3.2 Mating Connector

The listed part numbers can be ordered from HERTH+BUSS, KOSTAL or BOSCH with a minimum quantity of, for example, 100 pieces.

For lower quantities, TTControl GmbH provides complete kits with BOSCH connectors, crimp contacts and sealings. <chunk_seperator> This safety mechanism allows to detect a substantial amount of possible hardware failures and—with a proper secondary shut-off path in place—is therefore considered to yield a DC value of 90 %.

## 8.2.9.2 Shut-Off Path Test - - -

Category: Comment ID: 964457 In order to check the proper operation of the secondary shut-off path, its ability to transfer the system into a safe state needs to be tested in certain intervals, e.g. at the beginning of each driving cycle or during pre-defined maintenance activities. That way, the system can be considered to offer a valid category 2 architecture, according to ISO 13849.

## 8.2.9.3 Redundancy <chunk_seperator> This safety mechanism's diagnostic coverage is considered to lie between a value of **90-99** %, depending on the characteristics of the input elements (e.g. their possible failure modes) and the plausibility check's strictness.

## 8.2.9.4 Signal Range Check

Category: Comment ID: 923589 In order to check for short circuits to ground or battery voltage as well as open loads of dedicated inputs, a signal range check (SRC) can be utilized. That means a predefined margin on the upper and lower end of the measurable range is excluded from the sensor's valid output values. If for the signal range check a range of 5…95 % is considered to be valid for a sensor, all values below 5 % or above 95 % should be considered erroneous by the application software. <chunk_seperator> ## 8.2.9.3 Redundancy

Category: Comment ID: 894468 The redundant usage of independent inputs allows for continuous cross monitoring of the corresponding input signal. Plausibility checks within the application software permit the system integrator to detect a single fault in one of the input paths and transfer the overall system to a safe state. When defining the time interval of such checks, the system integrator needs to consider the overall system's failure reaction time. For details on calculating the worst case failure reaction times of such consistency checks, see section *Failure Diagnostics*.

Redundancy can also be claimed when combining two different input types (e.g. a digital output stage's analog input measurement with an analog input 3 mode, or a digital output stage's digital input measurement with a timer input), as long as the inputs' specifications both match the desired input signal. <chunk_seperator> In PVG mode, PVG valves have a well-defined input resistance, **and the output signal settings can** be calculated in advance by considering the characteristics of the output stage. In voltage mode, however, a PID controller must be applied to generate the desired output voltage. This results in a certain settling time, which depends on the parameter set of **the PID controllers.**
The VOUT **mode output can be used to control PVG valves of the type PVEU or other generic resistive**
loads.

For diagnostic reasons, the output signal is looped back to the CPU in output mode, and the measured value is compared to the set value. If the difference between these two values is above a fixed limit, an overload is detected and the output is disabled. The protection mechanism tries to reenable the output 10 times per drive cycle. It is not allowed to use two outputs in parallel to increase driving strength.

## 4.14.6.1 Characteristics Of Vout <chunk_seperator> Unlike the analog 2 mode and 3 mode inputs, the digital high side outputs do not offer an internal signal range check that is executed by the I/O driver's diagnostic modules. It is, therefore, in the responsibility of the application software to implement such a range check. Since this safety mechanism is able to detect only basic failure modes both internal and external to the HY-TTC 500 platform, the according diagnostic coverage is considered to be low, i.e. 60 %.

## 8.2.10 Digital Low Side Stages

Category: Comment ID: 894369 The digital low side stages allow operation of both resistive and inductive loads in a safety-critical manner. They feature internal feedback mechanisms that allow continuous monitoring of the effective output voltage.

Category: Comment ID: 924656 The current state of the digital low side outputs can be read via the static voltage feedback signals. That way, the application software is able to verify the correct function of the digital low side outputs and activate the safe state in case of dangerous failures. If the independent digital high side outputs are not used as secondary shut-off paths, the system integrator is responsible to provide other means that allow bringing the overall system to a safe state, e.g. by a separate emergency valve that disrupts the hydraulic oil flow and stops any dangerous movements. This safety mechanism allows to detect a substantial amount of possible hardware failures and—with a proper secondary shut-off path in place—is therefore considered to yield a DC value of 90 %.

Question:  What is the purpose of the I/O driver's diagnostic module in the context of the digital low side output stages?","The purpose of the I/O driver's diagnostic module in the context of the digital low side output stages is to continuously monitor and compare the desired output status with the actual feedback measurements. This continuous comparison allows the system to detect failures within the digital low side output stages. Specifically, the diagnostic module is designed to identify dangerous failures and trigger an error callback when such failures are detected. This measure is particularly active for every pair of digital high side output and digital low side output that is initialized as safety-critical.

If the digital low side output is not configured as safety-critical and is not used in combination with a digital high side output, the I/O driver's diagnostic modules do not execute any safety measures. This means that the safety mechanisms are only active when the outputs are configured in a manner that is deemed critical for safety, ensuring that the system can respond appropriately to potential failures and maintain a safe state.

In summary, the diagnostic module's primary role is to enhance the safety and reliability of the system by detecting and responding to failures in the digital low side output stages, thereby helping to prevent dangerous situations and maintain the system in a safe state."

Question:  Why is redundant usage of independent input stages recommended for the digital input configuration?","Redundant usage of independent input stages is recommended for the digital input configuration due to the potential failure modes of the digital low side stages that might not be detectable by the HY-TTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules. Specifically, certain failure modes, such as the unintentional activation of power stages, may go undetected. This lack of detection capability poses a risk to the safety functions that require a certain level of diagnostic coverage.

By employing redundant independent input stages, the system can ensure a higher level of reliability and safety. Redundancy in this context means that if one input stage fails or provides incorrect data, the other independent input stage can still provide accurate information, thereby maintaining the integrity of the safety function. This approach helps in achieving the necessary diagnostic coverage and ensures that the system can detect and respond to failures effectively, thereby maintaining a safe operational state.

In summary, the recommendation for redundant usage of independent input stages is to mitigate the risk of undetected failures in the digital input configuration, ensuring that the system can reliably detect and handle potential faults to maintain safety."

Category: Comment ID: 924656 The current state of the digital low side outputs can be read via the static voltage feedback signals. That way, the application software is able to verify the correct function of the digital low side outputs and activate the safe state in case of dangerous failures. If the independent digital high side outputs are not used as secondary shut-off paths, the system integrator is responsible to provide other means that allow bringing the overall system to a safe state, e.g. by a separate emergency valve that disrupts the hydraulic oil flow and stops any dangerous movements. This safety mechanism allows to detect a substantial amount of possible hardware failures and—with a proper secondary shut-off path in place—is therefore considered to yield a DC value of 90 %.

Question:  How does the redundant usage of independent inputs contribute to system safety according to section 8.2.10.3?","The redundant usage of independent inputs significantly enhances system safety by enabling continuous cross-monitoring of the corresponding input signals. This redundancy allows the system to perform plausibility checks within the application software, which are crucial for detecting single faults in one of the input paths. When a fault is detected, the system can transfer to a safe state, thereby preventing potential hazards.

The process involves defining time intervals for these plausibility checks, which must consider the overall system's failure reaction time. This ensures that the system can respond appropriately and promptly to any detected faults. The redundancy can be achieved by combining different types of inputs, such as a digital output stage's analog input measurement with an analog input 3 mode, or a digital output stage's digital input measurement with a timer input. The key requirement is that the specifications of these inputs must match the desired input signal.

Question:  What is the diagnostic coverage range for the safety mechanism described in the redundancy section, and what factors influence it?","The diagnostic coverage range for the safety mechanism described in the redundancy section is between 90-99%. Several factors influence this range:

1. **Characteristics of the Input Elements**: The possible failure modes of the input elements play a significant role. Different input elements may have varying susceptibilities to faults, which can affect the overall diagnostic coverage.

2. **Plausibility Check's Strictness**: The rigor with which the plausibility checks are implemented within the application software also impacts the diagnostic coverage. Stricter plausibility checks can detect faults more effectively, thereby increasing the diagnostic coverage.

3. **Combination of Input Types**: Redundancy can be achieved by combining different types of inputs, such as a digital output stage's analog input measurement with an analog input 3 mode, or a digital output stage's digital input measurement with a timer input. The specifications of these inputs must match the desired input signal for effective redundancy.

4. **Continuous Cross Monitoring**: The redundant usage of independent inputs allows for continuous cross monitoring of the corresponding input signal. This continuous monitoring helps in detecting single faults in one of the input paths and transferring the overall system to a safe state.

5. **Time Interval of Checks**: The system integrator must define the time interval for these checks, considering the overall system's failure reaction time. The frequency and timing of these checks can influence the effectiveness of fault detection and, consequently, the diagnostic coverage.

By considering these factors, the system integrator can ensure that the redundancy mechanism provides a high level of diagnostic coverage, ranging from 90% to 99%."

Question:  What is the function of a signal range check (SRC) in detecting short circuits or open loads, and what is its diagnostic coverage percentage?","A signal range check (SRC) is a safety mechanism used to detect short circuits to ground or battery voltage, as well as open loads in dedicated inputs.

For instance, if the valid range for a sensor is set between 5% and 95%, any values below 5% or above 95% are considered erroneous by the application software. This helps in identifying when the sensor output is outside the expected operational range, which could indicate a short circuit or an open load.

Question:  Why is it necessary for the system integrator to implement additional measures for the high side digital output stages' analog input measurement?","The necessity for the system integrator to implement additional measures for the high side digital output stages' analog input measurement arises from the lack of automatically enabled safety mechanisms within the HY-TTC 500 platform. Specifically, the high side digital output stages' analog input measurement does not come equipped with built-in safety features that can be claimed by the system integrator. This absence of inherent safety mechanisms means that the system integrator cannot rely on the platform's default settings to ensure the safety and reliability of the analog input function.

In safety-critical systems, it is crucial to have diagnostic coverage to detect and respond to potential failures. The analog input measurement in the high side digital output stages lacks this automatic diagnostic coverage, which could leave the system vulnerable to undetected faults. These faults could include issues such as signal degradation, incorrect readings, or complete signal loss, which could compromise the overall safety and functionality of the system.

To mitigate these risks, the system integrator must implement additional measures to provide the necessary diagnostic coverage. These measures could include:

1. **Redundant Input Stages**: Using multiple independent input stages to cross-check the analog input signals, ensuring that any discrepancies or faults can be detected and addressed promptly.
2. **Plausibility Checks**: Implementing software-based plausibility checks to verify the consistency and validity of the analog input signals. This involves comparing the input signals against expected ranges or patterns to identify any anomalies.
3. **Signal Range Checks**: Defining valid signal ranges and excluding values outside these ranges as erroneous. This helps in detecting short circuits, open loads, or other signal integrity issues.
4. **Regular Testing and Maintenance**: Conducting periodic tests and maintenance activities to ensure that the additional safety measures are functioning correctly and that the system remains in a safe state.

By implementing these additional measures, the system integrator can achieve the required diagnostic coverage and ensure that the high side digital output stages' analog input measurement meets the safety requirements of the overall system architecture. This proactive approach is essential for maintaining the reliability and safety of systems that rely on the HY-TTC 500 platform, especially in applications where safety is paramount."

That way, the application software is able to verify the correct function of the digital high side outputs and activate the safe state in case of dangerous failures. Since the HY-TTC 500 platform does not offer an integral shut-off path that allows to independently disable the connected actuator, the system integrator is responsible to provide other means that allow bringing the overall system to a safe state, e.g. by a separate emergency valve that disrupts the hydraulic oil flow and stops any dangerous movements or by utilizing an independent digital low side output of the HY-TTC 500 platform.

The following section will describe typical analog sensor types together with their detailed characteristics.

## 9.1.1 Usage Of Redundant Sensors

Category: Comment ID: 592125 Redundantly connected sensors do allow the reliable detection of failures within a single sensor path. 

However, for those failures that commonly compromise both sensor signals at once, e.g. short circuits between the separate sensor lines, dedicated preconditions are necessary.

## 9.1.1.1 Diverse Sensor Characteristics <chunk_seperator> Redundancy can also be claimed when combining two different input types (e.g. a digital output stage's analog input measurement with an analog input 3 mode, or a digital output stage's digital input measurement with a timer input), as long as the inputs' specifications both match the desired input signal. This safety mechanism's diagnostic coverage is considered to lie between a value of **90-99** %, depending on the characteristics of the input elements (e.g. their possible failure modes) and the plausibility check's strictness.

## 8.2.11.4 Signal Range Check <chunk_seperator> The timer input IO_PWD_00 to IO_PWD_05 can be alternatively **also used as digital (7/14 mA)** current loop sensor inputs. See Figure 40 **on the facing page.**
During power down (Terminal 15 **off), the ECU does not disconnect the timer and current loop**
sensor inputs. It is not recommended to supply the sensors permanently in order to prevent battery discharge. TTControl GmbH recommends one of the following 2 options:
1. Option 1**: Use a digital output for supplying the sensor. When the device is switched off, the**
ECU can perform an application-controlled shutdown, e. g., **in order to operate a cooling fan** to cool down an engine until the temperature is low enough or to store data in the non-volatile memory of the ECU. If the application controlled shut-down is finished, the ECU switches off and consumes less than 1 mA of battery current (including sensors). <chunk_seperator> L'échelle **prédéfinie peut être modifiée**

Category: Comment ID: 925638 In order to check for short circuits to ground or battery voltage as well as open loads of dedicated inputs, a signal range check (SRC) can be utilized. That means a predefined margin on the upper and lower end of the measurable range is excluded from the sensor's valid output values. If for the signal range check a range of 5…95 % is configured to be valid for a sensor, all values below 5 % or above 95 % should be considered erroneous by the application software. <chunk_seperator> ## 8.2.11.3 Redundancy

Category: Comment ID: 925634 The redundant usage of independent inputs allows for continuous cross monitoring of the corresponding input signal. Plausibility checks within the application software permit the system integrator to detect a single fault in one of the input paths and transfer the overall system to a safe state. When defining the time interval of such checks, the system integrator needs to consider the overall system's failure reaction time. For details on calculating the worst case failure reaction times of such consistency checks, see section *Failure Diagnostics*. <chunk_seperator> Unlike the analog 2 mode and 3 mode inputs, the digital high side outputs do not offer an internal signal range check that is executed by the I/O driver's diagnostic modules. It is, therefore, in the responsibility of the application software to implement such a range check. Since this safety mechanism is able to detect only basic failure modes both internal and external to the HY-TTC 500 platform, the according diagnostic coverage is considered to be low, i.e. 60 %.

Question:  How can the current state of the digital high side outputs be verified in the HY-TTC 500 platform?","The current state of the digital high side outputs in the HY-TTC 500 platform can be verified through the use of static feedback signals. These signals allow the application software to read the state of the digital high side outputs, thereby enabling the verification of their correct function. This verification process is crucial for ensuring that the system can activate a safe state in the event of dangerous failures.

However, it is important to note that the HY-TTC 500 platform does not have an integral shut-off path to independently disable the connected actuator. Therefore, the system integrator must provide alternative means to bring the overall system to a safe state. This can be achieved by implementing a separate emergency valve that disrupts the hydraulic oil flow to stop any dangerous movements or by using an independent digital low side output of the HY-TTC 500 platform.

This safety mechanism is designed to detect a substantial number of possible hardware failures. When a proper secondary shut-off path is in place, this mechanism is considered to yield a diagnostic coverage (DC) value of 90%. This high level of diagnostic coverage ensures that the system can reliably detect and respond to potential failures, maintaining the safety and integrity of the overall system."

Question:  How does the redundant usage of independent inputs contribute to system safety in the HY-TTC 500 platform?","The redundant usage of independent inputs significantly enhances system safety in the HY-TTC 500 platform by enabling continuous cross-monitoring and fault detection. Here’s a detailed explanation of how this redundancy contributes to system safety:

### Continuous Cross-Monitoring
Redundant inputs allow the system to continuously monitor the corresponding input signals. This means that the system can compare the signals from two independent inputs to ensure they are consistent with each other. If a discrepancy is detected, it indicates a potential fault in one of the input paths.

### Plausibility Checks
The application software performs plausibility checks on the input signals. These checks are designed to verify that the signals are within expected ranges and consistent with each other. If a signal falls outside the expected range or is inconsistent with its redundant counterpart, the system can identify this as a fault.

### Fault Detection and Safe State Activation
When a fault is detected in one of the input paths, the system can transfer the overall system to a safe state. This is crucial in preventing dangerous failures and ensuring the safety of the system. The ability to detect faults and activate a safe state helps in mitigating risks associated with hardware failures.

### Consideration of Failure Reaction Time
The system integrator must define the time interval for these plausibility checks, taking into account the overall system's failure reaction time. This ensures that faults are detected and addressed promptly, minimizing the risk of prolonged exposure to unsafe conditions.

### Diagnostic Coverage
The diagnostic coverage (DC) of this safety mechanism is considered to be between 90-99%, depending on the characteristics of the input elements and the strictness of the plausibility checks. This high level of diagnostic coverage indicates that the system can detect a substantial number of potential faults, thereby enhancing overall safety.

### Combining Different Input Types
Redundancy can also be achieved by combining different input types, such as:
- A digital output stage's analog input measurement with an analog input 3 mode.
- A digital output stage's digital input measurement with a timer input.

As long as the specifications of these inputs match the desired input signal, this combination can provide effective redundancy. This approach allows for diverse sensor characteristics, further enhancing the reliability and safety of the system.

### Summary
In summary, the redundant usage of independent inputs in the HY-TTC 500 platform contributes to system safety by enabling continuous cross-monitoring, performing plausibility checks, detecting faults, and activating safe states. The high diagnostic coverage and the ability to combine different input types further enhance the system's reliability and safety, making it well-suited for safety-critical applications."

Plausibility checks within the application software permit the system integrator to detect a single fault in one of the input paths and transfer the overall system to a safe state.

Question:  What is the purpose of a signal range check (SRC) in the context of the HY-TTC 500 platform?","The purpose of a signal range check (SRC) in the context of the HY-TTC 500 platform is to detect short circuits to ground or battery voltage as well as open loads of dedicated inputs.

For instance, if a range of 5% to 95% is configured to be valid for a sensor, any values below 5% or above 95% are considered erroneous by the application software. This mechanism helps in identifying basic failure modes both internal and external to the HY-TTC 500 platform.

That way, the application software is able to verify the correct function of the digital high side outputs and activate the safe state in case of dangerous failures. Since the HY-TTC 500 platform does not offer an integral shut-off path that allows to independently disable the connected actuator, the system integrator is responsible to provide other means that allow bringing the overall system to a safe state, e.g. by a separate emergency valve that disrupts the hydraulic oil flow and stops any dangerous movements or by utilizing an independent digital low side output of the HY-TTC 500 platform.

Question:  What are the requirements for analog sensors to be used in safety-critical applications with the HY-TTC 500 platform?","To use analog sensors in safety-critical applications with the HY-TTC 500 platform, several diagnostic measures and specific requirements must be met to ensure the reliability and safety of the system. Here are the detailed requirements:

1. **Diagnostic Measures**: The analog input path must include diagnostic measures to detect and handle potential failures. These measures are crucial for ensuring that the system can identify and respond to faults in a timely manner.

2. **Compliance with Specific Requirements**: Depending on the type of analog input, the system integrator must comply with specific requirements outlined in the section *Analog Inputs*. These requirements are designed to ensure that the analog sensors can be safely utilized in critical applications.

3. **Redundant Sensors**: The use of redundantly connected sensors is recommended to reliably detect failures within a single sensor path. Redundancy helps in cross-monitoring and verifying the accuracy of the sensor signals.

4. **Handling Common Failures**: For failures that can compromise both sensor signals simultaneously, such as short circuits between separate sensor lines, dedicated preconditions are necessary. This means that additional safety mechanisms or design considerations must be in place to handle such scenarios.

5. **Signal Range Check (SRC)**: To check for short circuits to ground or battery voltage, as well as open loads of dedicated inputs, a signal range check can be utilized. This involves excluding a predefined margin on the upper and lower end of the measurable range from the sensor's valid output values. For example, if a range of 5-95% is configured to be valid for a sensor, any values below 5% or above 95% should be considered erroneous by the application software.

7. **Diagnostic Coverage**: The diagnostic coverage of the signal range check is considered to be low, around 60%, as it can only detect basic failure modes both internal and external to the HY-TTC 500 platform.

Category: Comment ID: 592133 When identical sensors are used for redundancy, short circuits between both sensor lines cannot be detected, per se. However, two identical sensors will allow best precision regarding measurement accuracy.

Since the HY-TTC 500 platform does provide measures to identify external short circuits between two redundantly used sensors with identical characteristics, the system integrator can rely on the mechanisms to detect these external short circuits during start-up, as described in section *External Short* Circuit Check.

## 9.1.3  Current Loop Sensors <chunk_seperator> ## 9.1.1.1 Diverse Sensor Characteristics

Category: Comment ID: 592129 If redundant sensors are used for detection of short circuits between sensor lines, external to the ECU, 
sensors with diverse characteristics are recommended in order to continuously monitor the signal lines for external short circuits. The following types of diverse sensors are commonly used:
- Two identical potentiometers with opposite characteristics (i.e. when changing the physical input value, one sensor reacts with an increasing sensor value while the other one reacts with a decreasing sensor value). With a short circuit between those two sensors, the ECU will measure a value of 50 % full range for both sensors. This output value is plausible but wrong. <chunk_seperator> ## 9.1.3  Current Loop Sensors

ID: 592119 Category:
 Comment Current loop sensors are typically 2-wire sensors with one wire being connected to battery supply, while the other wire is connected to an ECU's analog input with current measurement capabilities. The standard current range is given with 4…24mA, where 4 mA corresponds to the minimum physical value while 24 mA is the maximum valid measurement value.

Category:
Comment ID:
592121 The following figure shows the typical wiring of current loop sensors.

![101_image_1.png]( The image displays a diagram of an electronic circuit with multiple components and connections. There are several wires connecting various parts of the circuit, including a transistor, a transformer, and other electrical devices. <chunk_seperator> As a consequence, this kind of diverse sensor operation is only feasible for sensors that result in safe output conditions when emitting a sensor value of 50 %. This could be, for example, a joystick containing two sensors with opposite characteristics. In its idle position, as well as when the sensor lines are shorted, it outputs sensor values of 50 %, each. Basically, a short circuit would not be detected by the application software, but this condition would lead to a safe condition, anyway.

- Two identical potentiometers with different proportional factor at their outputs. That could mean, for example, that the one sensor outputs a value that is double the voltage of the second sensor, for any position. That way, the both sensors can never show the same output values at the same time, enabling the application software to detect short circuits between these sensor lines.

## 9.1.1.2 Indentical Sensor Characteristics <chunk_seperator> Note 3: For details about the implementation of these safety measures see the according chapters in section *Analog Input 3 Modes*.

## - Voltage Input / Current Input:

Due to the analog 2 mode inputs' internal structure, internal diagnostics cannot realiably detect dangerous failures on their own. Even though a basic signal range check will be performed by the HYTTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules for redundantly configured analog inputs, additional measures might be required to achieve the overall safety function's diagnostic coverage for the analog input stages.

Digital Input: In the digital input configuration, certain failure modes of the analog input stages might not be detectable by the HY-TTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules. Hence, a redundant usage of independent input stages is recommended for safety functions that require a certain diagnostic coverage.

## 8.2.6 Timer Inputs (Io_Pwd_00 ... Io_Pwd_05) <chunk_seperator> ## 9.1.2 Potentiometric Analog Sensors

Category: Comment ID: 592117 Potentiometric analog sensors are commonly used for analog position sensors (e.g. pedals or joysticks), 
movement sensors or active sensors that resemble the behavior of potentiometers. These sensors produce an analog output voltage that is proportional to the mechanical position as well as to the sensor supply. Consequently, a linear position sensor being in its center position will show an output signal with a voltage of exactly 50 % of the sensor supply voltage. By using the ratiometric measurement, the sensor supply's error does not influence the measurement value accuracy. Please note that it is not allowed to supply a sensor by one ECU and measure the sensor's output signal on another ECU. Ground shifts between the two ECUs would considerably degrade the measurement accuracy.

Category: Comment ID: 592123 The following figure shows the typical wiring of potentiometric analog sensors.
Question:  What is the recommended sensor configuration for detecting short circuits between sensor lines external to the ECU?","For detecting short circuits between sensor lines external to the ECU, it is recommended to use sensors with diverse characteristics. This approach ensures continuous monitoring of the signal lines for external short circuits. The following configurations are commonly used:

1. **Two Identical Potentiometers with Opposite Characteristics**:
   - These sensors react oppositely to changes in the physical input value. For instance, when the input value increases, one sensor's output value increases while the other sensor's output value decreases.
   - In the event of a short circuit between these two sensors, the ECU will measure a value of 50% full range for both sensors. Although this output value is plausible, it is incorrect.
   - This configuration is only feasible for applications where a 50% sensor value results in a safe output condition. An example is a joystick with two sensors having opposite characteristics, which outputs 50% sensor values in its idle position and when the sensor lines are shorted, leading to a safe condition.

2. **Two Identical Potentiometers with Different Proportional Factors**:
   - In this setup, one sensor outputs a value that is a multiple (e.g., double) of the voltage of the second sensor for any given position.
   - This ensures that the two sensors can never show the same output values simultaneously, allowing the application software to detect short circuits between these sensor lines.

These configurations help in identifying and managing short circuits effectively, ensuring the system's safety and reliability."

Category: Comment ID: 592133 When identical sensors are used for redundancy, short circuits between both sensor lines cannot be detected, per se. However, two identical sensors will allow best precision regarding measurement accuracy.

Since the HY-TTC 500 platform does provide measures to identify external short circuits between two redundantly used sensors with identical characteristics, the system integrator can rely on the mechanisms to detect these external short circuits during start-up, as described in section *External Short* Circuit Check.

Category: Comment ID: 592129 If redundant sensors are used for detection of short circuits between sensor lines, external to the ECU, 
sensors with diverse characteristics are recommended in order to continuously monitor the signal lines for external short circuits. The following types of diverse sensors are commonly used:
- Two identical potentiometers with opposite characteristics (i.e. when changing the physical input value, one sensor reacts with an increasing sensor value while the other one reacts with a decreasing sensor value). With a short circuit between those two sensors, the ECU will measure a value of 50 % full range for both sensors. This output value is plausible but wrong. <chunk_seperator> ## 9.1.3  Current Loop Sensors

## - Voltage Input / Current Input:

Due to the analog 2 mode inputs' internal structure, internal diagnostics cannot realiably detect dangerous failures on their own. Even though a basic signal range check will be performed by the HYTTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules for redundantly configured analog inputs, additional measures might be required to achieve the overall safety function's diagnostic coverage for the analog input stages.

Digital Input: In the digital input configuration, certain failure modes of the analog input stages might not be detectable by the HY-TTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules. Hence, a redundant usage of independent input stages is recommended for safety functions that require a certain diagnostic coverage.

Category: Comment ID: 592117 Potentiometric analog sensors are commonly used for analog position sensors (e.g. pedals or joysticks), 
movement sensors or active sensors that resemble the behavior of potentiometers. These sensors produce an analog output voltage that is proportional to the mechanical position as well as to the sensor supply. Consequently, a linear position sensor being in its center position will show an output signal with a voltage of exactly 50 % of the sensor supply voltage. By using the ratiometric measurement, the sensor supply's error does not influence the measurement value accuracy. Please note that it is not allowed to supply a sensor by one ECU and measure the sensor's output signal on another ECU. Ground shifts between the two ECUs would considerably degrade the measurement accuracy.

Question:  How do two identical potentiometers with opposite characteristics behave when there is a short circuit between them?","When two identical potentiometers with opposite characteristics experience a short circuit between them, they exhibit a specific behavior due to their opposing response to changes in the physical input value. Here’s a detailed explanation of their behavior:

1. **Opposite Characteristics**: These potentiometers are designed such that when the physical input value changes, one potentiometer's output value increases while the other potentiometer's output value decreases. For example, if the physical input value is increased, potentiometer A might show an increasing voltage, while potentiometer B shows a decreasing voltage.

2. **Short Circuit Scenario**: When a short circuit occurs between the signal lines of these two potentiometers, the electrical connection between them causes their output values to equalize. This means that instead of showing their respective increasing and decreasing values, both potentiometers will output the same value.

3. **Output Value**: Due to the short circuit, the ECU (Electronic Control Unit) will measure a value of 50% of the full range for both potentiometers. This is because the short circuit forces the output values to a midpoint, which is 50% of the sensor's full range.

4. **Plausibility but Incorrectness**: The output value of 50% is plausible in the sense that it falls within the expected range of sensor values. However, it is incorrect because it does not reflect the true physical input value. The system might interpret this as a valid reading, but it is actually a result of the short circuit.

5. **Safe Output Conditions**: This kind of diverse sensor operation is only feasible if the application can tolerate or is designed to handle a 50% output value as a safe condition. For instance, in a joystick application, the idle position might naturally correspond to a 50% output value. Therefore, even if a short circuit occurs, the system remains in a safe state because the 50% output is considered a neutral or idle position.

In summary, when two identical potentiometers with opposite characteristics experience a short circuit between them, they both output a value of 50% of the full range. This output is plausible but incorrect, and the system must be designed to handle this condition safely."

Question:  What is the advantage of using two identical sensors for redundancy in terms of measurement accuracy?","Using two identical sensors for redundancy offers the advantage of achieving the highest precision in measurement accuracy. This is because identical sensors will have the same response characteristics and calibration, ensuring that any measurement taken by one sensor will be closely mirrored by the other. This uniformity minimizes discrepancies that could arise from sensor variability, leading to more reliable and accurate data.

In the context of the HY-TTC 500 platform, which includes mechanisms to detect external short circuits between two redundantly used sensors with identical characteristics, the system integrator can confidently rely on these measures to ensure the integrity of the sensor data. During start-up, the platform performs checks to identify any external short circuits, thereby maintaining the accuracy and reliability of the measurements.

In summary, the primary advantage of using two identical sensors for redundancy is the enhanced precision in measurement accuracy, as the identical nature of the sensors ensures consistent and reliable data, supported by the platform's ability to detect and manage potential short circuits."

Question:  Why is it not allowed to supply a sensor by one ECU and measure the sensor's output signal on another ECU?","It is not allowed to supply a sensor by one ECU and measure the sensor's output signal on another ECU due to the potential for ground shifts between the two ECUs. Ground shifts can significantly degrade the measurement accuracy of the sensor's output signal. 

When a sensor is supplied by one ECU, the reference ground for the sensor is tied to that ECU. If the output signal is then measured by a different ECU, the ground reference for the measurement may not be the same as the ground reference for the sensor supply. This discrepancy can introduce errors in the measurement due to differences in the ground potential between the two ECUs. These ground potential differences can cause inaccuracies in the analog signal, leading to incorrect readings and potentially compromising the system's reliability and safety.

In summary, to ensure accurate and reliable sensor measurements, it is crucial that both the supply and measurement of the sensor's output signal are handled by the same ECU, thereby maintaining a consistent ground reference and avoiding the issues associated with ground shifts."

Category: Comment ID: 592133 When identical sensors are used for redundancy, short circuits between both sensor lines cannot be detected, per se. However, two identical sensors will allow best precision regarding measurement accuracy.

Since the HY-TTC 500 platform does provide measures to identify external short circuits between two redundantly used sensors with identical characteristics, the system integrator can rely on the mechanisms to detect these external short circuits during start-up, as described in section *External Short* Circuit Check.

## 9.1.3  Current Loop Sensors <chunk_seperator> ## 9.1.1.1 Diverse Sensor Characteristics

Category: Comment ID: 592129 If redundant sensors are used for detection of short circuits between sensor lines, external to the ECU, 
sensors with diverse characteristics are recommended in order to continuously monitor the signal lines for external short circuits. The following types of diverse sensors are commonly used:
- Two identical potentiometers with opposite characteristics (i.e. when changing the physical input value, one sensor reacts with an increasing sensor value while the other one reacts with a decreasing sensor value). With a short circuit between those two sensors, the ECU will measure a value of 50 % full range for both sensors. This output value is plausible but wrong. <chunk_seperator> ## 9.1.3  Current Loop Sensors

 Comment Current loop sensors are typically 2-wire sensors with one wire being connected to battery supply, while the other wire is connected to an ECU's analog input with current measurement capabilities. The standard current range is given with 4…24mA, where 4 mA corresponds to the minimum physical value while 24 mA is the maximum valid measurement value.

![101_image_1.png]( The image displays a diagram of an electronic circuit with multiple components and connections. There are several wires connecting various parts of the circuit, including a transistor, a transformer, and other electrical devices. <chunk_seperator> As a consequence, this kind of diverse sensor operation is only feasible for sensors that result in safe output conditions when emitting a sensor value of 50 %. This could be, for example, a joystick containing two sensors with opposite characteristics. In its idle position, as well as when the sensor lines are shorted, it outputs sensor values of 50 %, each. Basically, a short circuit would not be detected by the application software, but this condition would lead to a safe condition, anyway.

- Two identical potentiometers with different proportional factor at their outputs. That could mean, for example, that the one sensor outputs a value that is double the voltage of the second sensor, for any position. That way, the both sensors can never show the same output values at the same time, enabling the application software to detect short circuits between these sensor lines.

## - Voltage Input / Current Input:

Due to the analog 2 mode inputs' internal structure, internal diagnostics cannot realiably detect dangerous failures on their own. Even though a basic signal range check will be performed by the HYTTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules for redundantly configured analog inputs, additional measures might be required to achieve the overall safety function's diagnostic coverage for the analog input stages.

Digital Input: In the digital input configuration, certain failure modes of the analog input stages might not be detectable by the HY-TTC 500 I/O driver's diagnostic modules. Hence, a redundant usage of independent input stages is recommended for safety functions that require a certain diagnostic coverage.

## 8.2.6 Timer Inputs (Io_Pwd_00 ... Io_Pwd_05) <chunk_seperator> ## 9.1.2 Potentiometric Analog Sensors

Category: Comment ID: 592117 Potentiometric analog sensors are commonly used for analog position sensors (e.g. pedals or joysticks), 
movement sensors or active sensors that resemble the behavior of potentiometers. These sensors produce an analog output voltage that is proportional to the mechanical position as well as to the sensor supply. Consequently, a linear position sensor being in its center position will show an output signal with a voltage of exactly 50 % of the sensor supply voltage. By using the ratiometric measurement, the sensor supply's error does not influence the measurement value accuracy. Please note that it is not allowed to supply a sensor by one ECU and measure the sensor's output signal on another ECU. Ground shifts between the two ECUs would considerably degrade the measurement accuracy.

Category: Comment ID: 592123 The following figure shows the typical wiring of potentiometric analog sensors.
Question:  What is the standard current range for current loop sensors and what do the minimum and maximum values correspond to?","The standard current range for current loop sensors is 4 to 24 mA. In this range, 4 mA corresponds to the minimum physical value, while 24 mA represents the maximum valid measurement value. This means that when the sensor detects the lowest possible physical quantity it is designed to measure, it will output a current of 4 mA. Conversely, when it detects the highest possible physical quantity, it will output a current of 24 mA. This range allows for a clear and standardized interpretation of the sensor's output, facilitating accurate and reliable measurements."

Question:  What diagnostic measures are required for the HY-TTC 500 platform to provide digital inputs for safety-critical applications?","To ensure the HY-TTC 500 platform can provide digital inputs for safety-critical applications, several diagnostic measures are required:

1. **Redundant Usage of Separate Digital Timer Inputs**: For general digital sensors, the system integrator must use separate digital timer inputs redundantly. This redundancy allows the application to monitor and compare the measurement values from independent inputs. If there are deviations between these inputs, the system must enter a safe state.

2. **PWM Position Sensors**:
   - **Redundant Timer Inputs**: Since PWM position sensors do not reliably detect failures such as short circuits or open circuits, redundant utilization of separate timer inputs is necessary. The application must monitor and compare the values from these inputs and enter a safe state if discrepancies are detected.

3. **RPM Sensors**:
   - **Test Pulse Emission**: RPM sensors should emit a test pulse (e.g., one pulse every 100 ms) while stationary. This helps distinguish between a non-rotating sensor and a defective sensor connection. If the signal remains stuck at any level, the application can infer a defect and activate the safe state.
   - **Redundant Timer Inputs**: Similar to PWM sensors, redundant utilization of two separate timer inputs is required. By comparing the measured values from both inputs, the application can identify sensor failures and switch to the safe state.

4. **Digital Switches**:
   - **Redundant Inputs**: Digital switches that emit static logical high or low levels typically do not have failure detection measures. Therefore, the system integrator must use two separate inputs redundantly. The application software is responsible for comparing these measurements and transitioning to the safe state if discrepancies are found.
   - **Debouncing Intermediate States**: During operation, redundantly used digital switches may show an offset in their switching thresholds, leading to implausible comparisons.

Question:  What are the characteristics of RPM sensors compatible with the HY-TTC 500 platform, and how can sensor failures be detected?","RPM sensors compatible with the HY-TTC 500 platform are characterized by the following features:

1. **Active Sensors with Magnetic Sensitivity**: These sensors primarily use magnetically sensitive detectors to measure rotational speed.
2. **3-Wire Connection**: They feature a 3-wire connection, which is essential for their operation.
3. **Power Supply Compatibility**: They can be supplied with either a 5 V supply or directly connected to battery voltage.
4. **Output Stages**: They provide either push-pull or open collector output stages.
5. **Rectangular Output Signal**: A rotary sensor wheel, such as a toothed gear wheel, produces a rectangular output signal on the sensor input. Each tooth passing the sensor wheel generates one pulse.

**Detection of Sensor Failures**:

To distinguish between a non-rotating sensor and a defective sensor connection (e.g., a shorted sensor line or a broken wire), the following measures can be applied:

1. **Test Pulse Emission**: An RPM sensor can emit a test pulse (e.g., one pulse every 100 ms) while standing still. If the signal remains stuck at any level, the application can infer that the sensor or its signal lines are defective and may activate the safe state.
2. **Redundant Utilization of Timer Inputs**: By using two separate timer inputs and comparing the measured values from both sensor inputs, the application can identify sensor failures. If there are discrepancies between the two inputs, the system can switch to the safe state to ensure safety.

These measures ensure that the system can reliably detect and respond to sensor failures, maintaining the integrity and safety of the application."

Question:  Why is redundant utilization of separate inputs necessary for digital switches in safety-critical applications?","Redundant utilization of separate inputs for digital switches in safety-critical applications is necessary due to the inherent limitations and potential failure modes of these switches. Digital switches typically emit static logical high or low levels, but they do not have built-in mechanisms to detect failures such as short circuits, open circuits, or other malfunctions. This lack of self-diagnostic capability means that a single switch could fail without any immediate indication, potentially leading to incorrect or unsafe system behavior.

To mitigate this risk, the system integrator must use two separate inputs for each digital switch. This redundancy allows the application software to continuously monitor and compare the measurements from both inputs. If there is a discrepancy between the two input values, it indicates a potential failure in one of the switches or its connections. The application can then enter a safe state to prevent any unsafe conditions from arising due to the faulty input.

Additionally, during operation, redundantly used digital switches may exhibit slight differences in their actual switching thresholds. This can result in a temporary period where the input values from the two switches appear inconsistent or implausible. To handle these intermediate states, the system integrator should implement adequate debouncing within the application software. Debouncing helps to filter out transient discrepancies and ensures that the system only reacts to genuine and sustained differences between the redundant inputs.

In summary, the redundant utilization of separate inputs for digital switches is crucial in safety-critical applications to detect and respond to potential failures, ensuring the system can maintain safe operation even in the presence of faults."

Question:  What issue might arise with redundantly used digital switches during operation, and how should it be addressed?","During operation, redundantly used digital switches may exhibit a certain offset regarding their actual switching threshold. This offset can lead to a situation where, for a particular time period, the comparison of the sensors' input values appears to be implausible. This means that the two digital switches might not switch at exactly the same time, causing temporary discrepancies in the input values that could be misinterpreted as a fault.

To address this issue, the system integrator is advised to implement adequate debouncing within the application software. Debouncing is a technique used to ensure that any transient discrepancies or noise in the signal are filtered out, allowing the system to correctly interpret the actual state of the switches. By providing this debouncing, the application can avoid false positives for sensor failures and ensure that the system only enters the safe state when there is a genuine discrepancy between the input values."

## Software Cycle
Question:  How does the HY-TTC 500 platform detect short circuits between two redundantly used sensors?","The HY-TTC 500 platform detects short circuits between two redundantly used sensors by utilizing independent sensor supply outputs and the ability to disable these outputs separately, one by one. Here’s a detailed explanation of the process:

1. **Independent Sensor Supply Outputs**: The platform provides separate power supplies for each sensor. This independence is crucial for isolating and identifying short circuits.

2. **Redundant Sensor Connection**: Redundant sensors are connected to different sensor supplies. This means that each sensor in a redundant pair is powered by a different supply output.

3. **Sequential Disabling of Sensor Supplies**: During the start-up phase, the system sequentially disables each sensor supply output. This is done one at a time to check the integrity of the sensor connections.

4. **Signal Verification**: When a sensor supply output is disabled, the system verifies that the signals from all sensors powered by that supply drop to a value close to zero. This drop indicates that the sensors are no longer receiving power and are behaving as expected.

5. **Detection of Short Circuits**: If a sensor still emits valid signals despite its supply being disabled, it suggests a short circuit to a redundant sensor that is still powered. This is because the sensor should not be able to function without its designated power supply unless it is receiving power from another source (i.e., a short circuit).

6. **Implementation in Application Software**: It is important to note that these short circuit checks are not performed by the diagnostic modules provided with the HY-TTC 500 platform. Instead, they need to be implemented within the application software developed by the system integrator. A typical implementation would involve a start-up test that sequentially enables and disables the sensor supplies, checking the corresponding set of functional sensors for each state.

By following this method, the HY-TTC 500 platform ensures that any short circuits between redundantly used sensors are detected during the start-up phase, thereby maintaining the integrity and safety of the system."

Question:  What is the Agriculture Performance Level (AgPL) and how is it categorized?","The Agriculture Performance Level (AgPL) is a discrete level used for specifying a system's ability to perform a safety function under foreseeable conditions in the context of agricultural machinery and systems. It is categorized into five levels, with each level representing a different degree of safety integrity. The levels are designated from 'a' to 'e', where:

- **AgPL e** has the highest level of safety integrity.
- **AgPL a** has the lowest level of safety integrity.

This categorization is defined by the ISO 25252-1 standard, which provides guidelines for assessing and ensuring the safety performance of agricultural systems. The higher the AgPL, the more stringent the safety requirements and the greater the system's ability to perform its safety functions reliably under expected conditions."

Redundant sensors are to be connected to different sensor supplies. That way, the freedom from short circuits can be checked during start-up by disabling a sensor supply output and verifying that the signals of all supplied sensors drop to a value close to zero. If a corresponding sensor still emits legal sensor values, a short circuit to a redundant (and still supplied) sensor is very likely. These short circuit checks will, however, not be performed by the diagnostic modules provided with the HY-TTC 500 platform. Instead, they need to be implemented within the application software. A possible implementation for such a short circuit check would be a start-up test that sequentially enables the sensor supplies and checks the corresponding set of functional sensors for <chunk_seperator> Fault Abnormal condition that may cause a reduction in, or loss of, the capability of a functional unit to perform a required function.

Fault Tolerance The ability of a functional unit to continue to perform a required function in the presence of faults or errors. Failure The termination of the ability of a functional unit to perform a required function.

Question:  What is the role of the system integrator in the context of the HY-TTC 500?","The role of the system integrator in the context of the HY-TTC 500 involves several critical responsibilities:

1. **Defining and Developing the System**: The system integrator is tasked with defining the overall system architecture and developing the system in which the HY-TTC 500 will be integrated. This includes specifying the system requirements, designing the system layout, and ensuring that all components work together seamlessly.

2. **Integrating the HY-TTC 500**: The system integrator must integrate the HY-TTC 500, which is a safety-relevant Electronic Control Unit (ECU) developed by TTControl, into the broader system. This involves configuring the HY-TTC 500 to meet the specific needs of the application, ensuring compatibility with other system components, and implementing necessary interfaces.

3. **Ensuring Safe Operation**: One of the most crucial responsibilities of the system integrator is to ensure the safe operation of the application. This includes conducting thorough testing and validation to confirm that the HY-TTC 500 and the overall system meet all safety requirements and standards. The system integrator must also perform risk assessments and implement safety measures to mitigate potential hazards.

4. **Compliance with Standards**: The system integrator must ensure that the system complies with relevant safety standards such as ISO 13849, IEC 61508, and ISO 25119. This involves understanding and applying the requirements of these standards to the system design and integration process.

5. **Documentation and Reporting**: The system integrator is responsible for maintaining detailed documentation of the system design, integration process, and safety measures. This includes creating and updating system manuals, safety manuals, and other relevant documents as referenced in the provided context.

In summary, the system integrator plays a pivotal role in ensuring that the HY-TTC 500 is effectively integrated into the system and that the entire system operates safely and in compliance with applicable safety standards."

Question:  What does the acronym ABI stand for, and what is its relevance?","The acronym ABI stands for Application Binary Interface. An ABI is a critical concept in computing and software development, as it defines the low-level interface between two program modules, one of which is often a library or operating system. The ABI specifies details such as:

1. **Calling Conventions**: How functions receive parameters and return values, including the use of registers and stack.
2. **Binary Format**: The format of executable files, object files, and shared libraries.
3. **Data Types and Alignment**: The size, layout, and alignment of data types in memory.
4. **System Calls**: The interface for invoking operating system services.

The relevance of an ABI is significant in ensuring compatibility and interoperability between different software components. For instance, when a program is compiled, the compiler generates machine code that adheres to the ABI of the target platform. This allows the compiled program to interact correctly with other binary components, such as libraries and the operating system, without requiring source code compatibility.

In the context of system integration, particularly with safety-relevant ECUs like the HY-TTC 500, adhering to a well-defined ABI ensures that the integrated system components can communicate and function together reliably and safely. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity and performance of the overall system, especially in applications where safety and real-time performance are paramount."
