TTControl GmbH recommends using the HY-TTC 500 Starter Kit, because it includes all components required for smooth development. There are two variants of the HY-TTC 500 Starter Kit available: one for C programming (with JTAG-Adapter and open housing) and one for CODESYS programming. This Quick Start Guide is for the C programming variant (see Figure 3.2 on the following page). For the CODESYS programming variant, see [5]. Note that the Ethernet USB adapter is only part of the starter kit if the corresponding HY-TTC 500 ECU is equipped with an Ethernet interface. <chunk_seperator> <table_3>[{'5.31': 'Environment variable T32ID page'}, {'--------': '--------------------------------------------------', '-----': '------'}, {'5.32': 'Device software installation'}, {'5.33': 'Environment variable T32TMP page'}, {'5.34': 'Prepare TRACE32 for Integration. . . page'}, {'5.35': 'Select way to submit registration page'}, {'5.36': 'TRACE32 software is successfully finished page'}, {'5.37': 'JTAG Adapter Board'}, {'5.38': 'JTAG Cable'}, {'5.39': 'HY-TTC 500 with JTAG connector and LEDs'}, {'5.40': 'Lauterbach connection to HY-TTC 580 (1)'}, {'5.41': 'Lauterbach connection to HY-TTC 580 (2)'}, {'5.42': 'HY-TTC 500 with LEDs'}, {'5.43': 'HY-TTC 500 with JTAG connector and signal pins'}, {'5.44': 'Trace32 and .cmm batch file'}, {'5.45': 'Flash application dialog'}, {'5.46': 'Reset Trace32 windows dialog'}, {'5.47': 'Trace32 Window after flashing'}, {'5.48': 'TTC-Downloader'}, {'6.1': 'Memory map for HY-TTC 500 internal Flash'}, {'6.2': 'Memory map for HY-TTC 500 external RAM <chunk_seperator> Type page'}, {'5.24': 'Setup Type page'}, {'5.25': 'TRACE32 Product Type page'}, {'5.26': 'Maintenance Notice page'}, {'5.27': 'Debugger Interface Type page'}, {'5.28': 'OS Selection page'}, {'5.29': 'CPU selection page'}, {'5.30': 'TRACE32 executable type dialog'}]</table_2> <chunk_seperator> 5.3 Overview of control LEDs

The endianness of the ARM Cortex-R4F core of the TI TMS570 CPU is configured to BE32**. Bigendian systems store the most significant byte of a multi-byte data field in the lowest memory address. Also, the address of the multi-byte data field is the lowest address.**
Note The endianness of the HY-TTC 500 controllers can not be changed.

## 3 I/O Driver Memory Protection

The concept of memory protection becomes relevant when the user application is partitioned into components with different safety levels. The aim is that the **memory reserved for safety critical** software components (safe code) cannot be corrupted by faults in non-critical components (unsafe code). <chunk_seperator> <table_4>[{'Nr.': 'Starter Kit Components'}, {'-------': '-----------------------------------------------'}, {'1': 'HY-TTC 500 ECU open housing'}, {'2': 'JTAG adapter'}, {'3': 'JTAG adapter cable'}, {'4': 'Interface board'}, {'5': 'Cable harness 1.5 m'}, {'6': 'Installation CD C-Programming'}, {'7': 'Ethernet USB adapter with driver and software'}, {'8': 'PCAN USB adapter with driver and software'}, {'9': 'Datacable 2m'}, {'10': 'Quick Start Guide'}]</table_4>

## Count Direction <chunk_seperator> ## 6.5.9.2 Motor Breaking

Motor braking is managed by switching on both high side power **stages simultaneously.**
Always switch off low side first before switching on high side. Never switch on high side while low side is still on. Please observe that the high side power stages can only measure current in positive direction (out of the terminal towards ground) While the high side power stages are actively braking, one power stage (this one that was operated before entering brake mode) shows a high current (close to start current) declining to 0 A, while the other is reverse operated and does not show any current at all. The brake sequence is considered to be finished when the brake **current falls below 1 A. By using** multiple power stages the limit is 1 A per power stage. A reverse motor run now can be started.

## 6.5.9.3 Paralleled High Side Power Stage Control <chunk_seperator> ![9_image_0.png]( The image displays a computer screen with German text on it. There are two buttons visible at the bottom of the screen, one labeled ""Anleitungen"" and the other labeled ""Output"".

These numbers seem to be related to the functioning or configuration of the electronic device.

The circuit board is filled with various components, including a total of sixteen buttons arranged in different positions on the board. Some of these buttons are located near the top left corner, while others can be found scattered across the middle and right side of the board. The presence of multiple buttons suggests that this electronic device may have complex functions or require user input for its operation.)

## 4.3 Hy-Ttc 500 Power Supply

- Connect the power supply GND to the black socket named **BAT-**. <chunk_seperator> The scene also includes a person standing next to the box, possibly admiring or working with the electronics inside. The combination of the white box, blue handle, and assorted electronics creates a visually appealing image that showcases both the contents and the overall design of the box.)

Motor braking is managed by switching on both high side power **stages simultaneously.**
Always switch off low side first before switching on high side. Never switch on high side while low side is still on. Please observe that the high side power stages can only measure current in positive direction (out of the terminal towards ground) While the high side power stages are actively braking, one power stage (this one that was operated before entering brake mode) shows a high current (close to start current) declining to 0 A, while the other is reverse operated and does not show any current at all. The brake sequence is considered to be finished when the brake **current falls below 1 A. By using** multiple power stages the limit is 1 A per power stage. A reverse motor run now can be started.

## Count Direction <chunk_seperator> ## 6.5.9.2 Motor Breaking

Motor braking is managed by switching on both high side power **stages simultaneously.**
Always switch off low side first before switching on high side. Never switch on high side while low side is still on. Please observe that the high side power stages can only measure current in positive direction (out of the terminal towards ground) While the high side power stages are actively braking, one power stage (this one that was operated before entering brake mode) shows a high current (close to start current) declining to 0 A, while the other is reverse operated and does not show any current at all. The brake sequence is considered to be finished when the brake **current falls below 1 A. By using** multiple power stages the limit is 1 A per power stage. A reverse motor run now can be started.

## 4.7 Hy-Ttc 500 Download And Debugging

For application download to and debugging of HY-TTC 500 there are the following options:
- For download and debugging via **JTAG** it is possible to use the **Lauterbach Power Debug**
Module with the **TTControl JTAG Adapter Board** and Lauterbach Batch files (***.cmm**).

- For download via CAN it is possible to use the **TTControl Downloader (TTC-Downloader)**
and the **Peak PCAN-USB Adapter**.

- For download via **Ethernet** it is possible to use the **TTControl Downloader** and an Ethernet Interface. <chunk_seperator> '--------------'}, {'IO_PWM_18 IO_PWM_18 IO_Pin.h 275 IO_PWM_19 IO_PWM_19 IO_Pin.h 275 IO_PWM_20 IO_PWM_20 IO_Pin.h 276 IO_PWM_21 IO_PWM_21 IO_Pin.h 276 IO_PWM_22 IO_PWM_22 IO_Pin.h 276 IO_PWM_23 IO_PWM_23 IO_Pin.h 276 IO_PWM_24 IO_PWM_24 IO_Pin.h 276 IO_PWM_25 IO_PWM_25 IO_Pin.h 276 IO_PWM_26 IO_PWM_26 IO_Pin.h 276 IO_PWM_27 IO_PWM_27 IO_Pin.h 276 IO_PWM_28 IO_PWM_28 IO_Pin.h 277 IO_PWM_29 IO_PWM_29 IO_Pin.h 277 IO_PWM_30 IO_PWM_30 IO_Pin.h 277 IO_PWM_31 IO_PWM_31 IO_Pin.h 277 IO_PWM_32 IO_PWM_32 IO_Pin.h 277 IO_PWM_33 IO_PWM_33': 'IO_Pin.h 277'}]</table_277>
Question:  What is recommended for unexperienced users when downloading applications to the HY-TTC 500?","For unexperienced users of the HY-TTC 500, it is recommended to use either the CAN or JTAG option for downloading applications. These methods are considered more straightforward and user-friendly compared to the Ethernet option. Specifically:

1. **CAN Option**: Utilize the TTControl Downloader (TTC-Downloader) along with the Peak PCAN-USB Adapter. This method is likely simpler and more intuitive for those who are not familiar with the intricacies of the HY-TTC 500.

2. **JTAG Option**: Use the Lauterbach Power Debug Module with the TTControl JTAG Adapter Board and Lauterbach Batch files (***.cmm**). This method provides a robust debugging environment that can be easier to manage for beginners.

The Ethernet option, while available, requires additional steps and considerations. If an application is already flashed to the target, the application must be configured to listen to download requests on the Ethernet. The example application provided in the Quick Start Guide does not have this capability, which could complicate the process for unexperienced users."

Question:  What is the purpose of the **template** directory in the context of starting a new project?","The **template** directory serves as a foundational starting point for new projects. It is designed to provide a structured and organized base that includes all the necessary subdirectories and files required to initiate a project efficiently. Here is a detailed breakdown of its purpose and contents:

1. **bsp (Board Support Package)**:
   - This subdirectory contains files specific to the linker and board objects. These files are essential for ensuring that the project is correctly configured to work with the specific hardware it is intended for.

2. **build**:
   - This is an empty folder where the generated files are placed during the compile process. It acts as a workspace for the build outputs, keeping them organized and separate from the source files.

3. **env (Environment)**:
   - This subdirectory includes auxiliary tools that assist in the development process. For example:
     - **AddAPDB.exe**: This tool patches the **.hex** files with the CRC checksum, application size, and build date, ensuring the integrity and versioning of the compiled code.
     - **nowECC.exe**: This tool generates a second file containing the corresponding ECC (Error Correction Code) data, which is particularly useful if the Lauterbach Device is used for flashing the device.

4. **inc (Include)**:
   - This subdirectory contains all the header files necessary for creating a project using the C programming language. These header files define the interfaces and structures used throughout the project, promoting code reuse and modularity.

5. **lib (Libraries)**:
   - This subdirectory houses the libraries required for the project. For instance:
     - **ttc500.lib**: This library is for the hardware driver.
     - **bsp.lib**: This library contains the startup code necessary for initializing the hardware and software environment.

6. **src (Source)**:
   - This subdirectory contains the source code files needed to create a project using the C programming language. It is the main area where the developer writes and maintains the codebase.

By providing these subdirectories and their respective contents, the **template** directory ensures that every new project starts with a well-organized and comprehensive structure. This setup helps developers avoid the repetitive task of creating these directories and files from scratch for each new project, thereby saving time and reducing the potential for errors. It also promotes consistency across different projects, making it easier to manage and maintain them over time."

The screen appears to be a part of an operating system setup, with various options laid out for the user to select and proceed with their desired actions.)
Question:  What is the role of the **Settings.mk** file in the development environment?","The **Settings.mk** file plays a crucial role in the development environment by providing a centralized location for defining various settings and configurations that the **Makefile** will use during the build process. Here are the key roles and functionalities of the **Settings.mk** file:

1. **Hardware Type Specification**:
   - The file includes a setting for the **TTC-Downloader hardware type** (`DOWNLOADER_HW_TYPE`), which specifies the hardware type for which the `AddAPDB.exe` tool should compile. This ensures that the compiled code is compatible with the specific hardware being targeted.

2. **Bootloader Version**:
   - It defines the **Bootloader version** (`BOOTLOADER_VERSION`), which is essential for ensuring that the correct version of the bootloader is used during the build process. This can help in maintaining compatibility and stability across different versions of the bootloader.

3. **Compiler Path**:
   - The **path with C compiler** (`C_COMP_PATH`) is specified in the file. This path points to the location of the C compiler that will be used to compile the source code. By defining this path, the build process can locate and use the correct compiler without manual intervention.

4. **Optimization Type**:
   - The file includes settings for **compile code for profiling or debugging** (`OPT_TYPE`). This setting allows the developer to choose between different optimization levels:
     - `0` for profiling
     - `1` for debugging
     - `2` for release
   - Depending on the value of `OPT_TYPE`, the corresponding optimization string (`OPT_STR`) is set to `PROFILING`, `DEBUGGING`, or `RELEASE`. This helps in tailoring the build process to the specific needs of the development or production environment.

5. **Conditional Compilation**:
   - The file uses conditional statements (`ifeq`) to set the optimization string based on the value of `OPT_TYPE`. This allows for flexible and dynamic configuration of the build process, ensuring that the correct optimization settings are applied based on the current development stage.

In summary, the **Settings.mk** file is essential for configuring the build environment, specifying hardware and bootloader versions, defining the compiler path, and setting optimization levels. It ensures that the build process is consistent, reproducible, and tailored to the specific requirements of the project."

Question:  What are the two predefined values for OPT_TYPE, and what do they configure?","The **OPT_TYPE** parameter in the **Settings.mk** file has two predefined values that configure the compiler options for different purposes:

1. **OPT_TYPE = 1**: This value configures the compiler options for **debugging**. When set to 1, the compiler includes debugging symbols in the compiled code, which are essential for debugging the application. These symbols provide detailed information about the code structure, such as variable names, function names, and line numbers, which can be used by debugging tools to help developers identify and fix issues in the code.

2. **OPT_TYPE = 2**: This value configures the compiler options for a **release build**. When set to 2, the compiler optimizes the code for performance and size, removing debugging symbols and other information that is not necessary for the final executable. This results in a more efficient and compact application, suitable for deployment in a production environment.

These predefined values allow developers to easily switch between a debugging configuration and a release configuration, depending on their current needs during the development process."

Constant data is linked to the application region by default. However, it can also be linked to the external flash memory (if available) or to the application configuration data region. The major difference is the integrity protection of their respective contents. While constant data linked to the external flash memory is protected by the application CRC, the application configuration data region's integrity must be ensured by the application itself. Figure 5.19 on the facing page depicts an example of how to link constant data to the external flash memory as well as to the application configuration data region.

It provides a short overview of the available I/O driver functions as well as detailed descriptions of those functions, including parameters, return values and examples.

## Figure 5.19: Linking Constant Data To The External Flash And/Or Application Configuration Data 5.7.5 Safety Configuration

For safety-critical applications, every safety-critical IO pin can be initialized with a safety configuration. Please refer to **HY-TTC_500_Series_C_API_Manual.chm** [4] for further details.

To enable any outputs, the I/O Driver has to be configured with a valid safety configuration. The I/O Driver safety configuration consists of several elements:
- **command_period [**µs]: Sets the period at which the application cycle is executed.

Important: The **command_period** is checked by the watchdog and has to meet the window configuration.

- **window_size [%]**: Configures the size of the window for the watchdog which checks the command_period. The application cycle has to fulfill those timing requirements. <chunk_seperator> ```

UNSIGNED specifies unsigned whole numbers. This means that only positive figures can be displayed using this data type. The data length in bytes is added as a suffix. UNSIGNED32 is a whole numeric value without a sign and with a data length of 32 bits. 

<table_12>[{'Data type': 'Length [Bit]', 'Min.': 'Max.'}, {'-------------': '----------------', '--------': '------------'}, {'UNSIGNED8': '8', '0': '+255'}, {'UNSIGNED16': '16', '0': '+65.535'}, {'UNSIGNED32': '32', '0': '4294967295'}]</table_12>
For the illustration of data in a data block of more than 1 byte of length, the bit order has to be paid attention to; see chapter 2.3 Bit **order.** 

## 2.4.3. Boolean

The data type BOOLEAN is used to illustrate binary signals. These are signals which are not able to adopt more than two logical states. The data length in the memory may vary. If an individual binary signal is stored in the memory, the data type is usually an *UNSIGNED8*. <chunk_seperator> ```

Constant data is linked to the application region by default. However, it can also be linked to the external flash memory (if available) or to the application configuration data region. The major difference is the integrity protection of their respective contents. While constant data linked to the external flash memory is protected by the application CRC, the application configuration data region's integrity must be ensured by the application itself.

For safety-critical applications, every safety-critical IO pin can be initialized with a safety configuration. Please refer to **HY-TTC_500_Series_C_API_Manual.chm** [4] for further details.

To enable any outputs, the I/O Driver has to be configured with a valid safety configuration. The I/O Driver safety configuration consists of several elements:
- **command_period [**µs]: Sets the period at which the application cycle is executed.

Important: The **command_period** is checked by the watchdog and has to meet the window configuration.

- **window_size [%]**: Configures the size of the window for the watchdog which checks the command_period. The application cycle has to fulfill those timing requirements. <chunk_seperator> ```

Question:  What are the differences in integrity protection between constant data linked to external flash memory and the application configuration data region?","The integrity protection of constant data linked to external flash memory and the application configuration data region differs significantly in terms of how their contents are safeguarded:

1. **External Flash Memory:**
   - **Protection Mechanism:** Constant data linked to the external flash memory is protected by the application CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check).
   - **Implications:** This means that any modification to the data in the external flash memory will result in an invalid application CRC, thereby ensuring that the integrity of the data is maintained. The CRC acts as a checksum to detect any changes or corruption in the data, providing a robust mechanism to ensure data integrity.

2. **Application Configuration Data Region:**
   - **Protection Mechanism:** The integrity of the data in the application configuration data region is not protected by the application CRC.
   - **Implications:** The responsibility for ensuring the integrity of the data in this region falls on the application itself. This means that the application must implement its own mechanisms to verify and maintain the integrity of the configuration data. Without such mechanisms, the data in this region is more vulnerable to corruption or unintended modifications.

In summary, while the external flash memory benefits from automatic integrity protection via the application CRC, the application configuration data region requires the application to actively manage and ensure the integrity of its data."

Constant data is linked to the application region by default. However, it can also be linked to the external flash memory (if available) or to the application configuration data region. The major difference is the integrity protection of their respective contents. While constant data linked to the external flash memory is protected by the application CRC, the application configuration data region's integrity must be ensured by the application itself. Figure 5.19 on the facing page depicts an example of how to link constant data to the external flash memory as well as to the application configuration data region.

The table contains various numbers and text, possibly providing more context or details about the flowchart.)

Be aware that the duration of each cycle is 10000 µs in this case. See also Figure 5.17 on the previous page, parameter **safety_conf.command_period**.

## 5.7.3 Help For C Driver Functions

The I/O driver API documentation (**HY-TTC_500_IO_Driver_Manual_V3.1.0.chm** [4]) is available in the compiled HTML format and can be found in **Documentation > Manuals**. It provides a short overview of the available I/O driver functions as well as detailed descriptions of those functions, including parameters, return values and examples.

## 5.7.4 Linking Constant Data <chunk_seperator> */

## Figure 5.19: Linking Constant Data To The External Flash And/Or Application Configuration Data 5.7.5 Safety Configuration

For safety-critical applications, every safety-critical IO pin can be initialized with a safety configuration. Please refer to **HY-TTC_500_Series_C_API_Manual.chm** [4] for further details.

To enable any outputs, the I/O Driver has to be configured with a valid safety configuration. The I/O Driver safety configuration consists of several elements:
- **command_period [**µs]: Sets the period at which the application cycle is executed.

Important: The **command_period** is checked by the watchdog and has to meet the window configuration.

- **window_size [%]**: Configures the size of the window for the watchdog which checks the command_period. The application cycle has to fulfill those timing requirements. <chunk_seperator> ```

Unsigned

UNSIGNED specifies unsigned whole numbers. This means that only positive figures can be displayed using this data type. The data length in bytes is added as a suffix. UNSIGNED32 is a whole numeric value without a sign and with a data length of 32 bits. 

<table_12>[{'Data type': 'Length [Bit]', 'Min.': 'Max.'}, {'-------------': '----------------', '--------': '------------'}, {'UNSIGNED8': '8', '0': '+255'}, {'UNSIGNED16': '16', '0': '+65.535'}, {'UNSIGNED32': '32', '0': '4294967295'}]</table_12>
For the illustration of data in a data block of more than 1 byte of length, the bit order has to be paid attention to; see chapter 2.3 Bit **order.** 

## 2.4.3. Boolean

The data type BOOLEAN is used to illustrate binary signals. These are signals which are not able to adopt more than two logical states. The data length in the memory may vary. If an individual binary signal is stored in the memory, the data type is usually an *UNSIGNED8*. <chunk_seperator> ```

Question:  What elements are included in the I/O Driver safety configuration for safety-critical applications?","The I/O Driver safety configuration for safety-critical applications includes several key elements:

1. **command_period [µs]**: This parameter sets the period at which the application cycle is executed. It is crucial for ensuring that the application runs at the correct intervals. The duration of each cycle is specified as 10000 µs in this case. The **command_period** is monitored by the watchdog to ensure it meets the window configuration requirements.

2. **window_size [%]**: This parameter configures the size of the window for the watchdog that checks the **command_period**. The application cycle must adhere to these timing requirements to ensure proper operation and safety.

These elements are essential for configuring the I/O Driver to ensure that safety-critical IO pins are initialized and operated correctly within the specified safety parameters."

- **glitch_filter_time [ms]**: Sets the time a temporary error condition must persist to cause an error reaction by the safety function.

- **error_callback**: Configures the error callback for the application. It can be set to **NULL** to disable the error callback.

Other software modules (e.g. additional libraries for CANopen Safety protocol implementations or CODESYS runtimes) are not part of the HY-TTC 500 safety platform. Therefore, if such modules are used with safety-critical applications, these modules **shall** either be classified as 'proven in use' according to the requirements of IEC 61508 [IEC 61508], ISO 25119 [ISO 25119] and ISO 13849 [ISO 13849] or verified and validated by the system integrator according to the requirements of the associated performance level. This verification and validation also applies to generated C or object code by tools used during application development.
Question:  How does the **reset_behavior** parameter affect the CPU in case of a safety-critical error?","The **reset_behavior** parameter plays a crucial role in managing the CPU's response to safety-critical errors. When a safety-critical error occurs, the watchdog mechanism, which is configured by the **reset_behavior** parameter, will reset the CPU. This reset process is intended to clear the error condition and allow the system to attempt to recover and continue operation.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of how the **reset_behavior** parameter affects the CPU:

1. **Initial Error Detection**: When the watchdog detects a safety-critical error, it triggers a reset of the CPU. This is the first line of defense to handle transient errors that might be resolved by a simple restart.

2. **Number of Resets**: The **reset_behavior** parameter configures how many times the watchdog is allowed to reset the CPU in response to an error. This means that if the error persists after the initial reset, the watchdog will continue to reset the CPU up to the configured maximum number of times.

3. **Permanent Safe State**: If the error condition persists even after the maximum number of allowed resets, the system will enter a permanent safe state. This is a fail-safe mechanism to ensure that the system does not continue to operate in an unsafe condition. Entering a permanent safe state typically means that the system will halt operations and require manual intervention to diagnose and resolve the underlying issue.

By configuring the **reset_behavior** parameter, system designers can balance between allowing the system to recover from transient errors through multiple resets and ensuring safety by halting operations if the error condition is persistent and cannot be resolved through resets. This approach helps in maintaining the reliability and safety of the application, especially in environments where safety is critical."

Question:  How can the **error_callback** and **notify_callback** be configured in the application?","The **error_callback** and **notify_callback** in the application can be configured by setting them to specific functions or to **NULL** if you wish to disable them. Here’s a detailed explanation of how you can configure these callbacks:

1. **error_callback**:
   - This callback is used to handle error conditions in the application. You can configure it by assigning a function that will be called whenever an error occurs. This function should be designed to handle the specific error conditions that your application might encounter.
   - If you do not want to use an error callback, you can set it to **NULL**. This will disable the error callback functionality, meaning that no specific function will be called when an error occurs.

2. **notify_callback**:
   - This callback is used to handle notifications in the application. Similar to the error callback, you can configure it by assigning a function that will be called whenever a notification needs to be handled. This function should be designed to process the notifications appropriately.
   - If you do not want to use a notification callback, you can set it to **NULL**. This will disable the notification callback functionality, meaning that no specific function will be called when a notification is generated.

### Example Configuration

Here is an example of how you might configure these callbacks in your application code:

```c
// Define the error callback function
void myErrorCallback() {
    // Handle the error
    printf(""An error has occurred!\n"");
}

// Define the notification callback function
void myNotifyCallback() {
    // Handle the notification
    printf(""A notification has been received!\n"");
}

int main() {
    // Configure the error callback
    error_callback = myErrorCallback;

    // Configure the notification callback
    notify_callback = myNotifyCallback;

    // Alternatively, to disable the callbacks, set them to NULL
    // error_callback = NULL;
    // notify_callback = NULL;

    // Rest of the application code
    return 0;
}
```

In this example:
- `myErrorCallback` is a function that will be called whenever an error occurs.
- `myNotifyCallback` is a function that will be called whenever a notification is received.
- These functions are assigned to `error_callback` and `notify_callback` respectively.
- If you want to disable these callbacks, you can set `error_callback` and `notify_callback` to **NULL**.

By configuring these callbacks, you can ensure that your application handles errors and notifications in a way that is appropriate for your specific use case."

The hardware for the debugger is universal and allows interfacing different target processors by simply changing the debug cable and the software. <chunk_seperator> In addition to these buttons, there are several other elements present in the image. These include a keyboard and a mouse located near the bottom left corner of the screen, as well as two more buttons situated towards the top right side. The overall scene suggests that the user is about to install or configure software on their computer system.)

![37_image_1.png]( The image shows a computer screen displaying a software installation process for an operating system. There is a message on the screen that reads ""Please select setup type for installation."" A button labeled ""New Installation"" can be seen below this message.

In addition to the main text, there are two smaller buttons located at the bottom right corner of the screen. The first one is labeled ""Back,"" and the second one is labeled ""Cancel."" These buttons likely allow the user to navigate through different options or cancel the installation process if needed.) <chunk_seperator> 4.

as specified by the HY-TTC 500 System Manual [TTC500-SysM], Part II: Software Description.

Category: Requirement Label: 3rd-Party_SW ID: 586813 Related To: Related To':
Other software modules (e.g. additional libraries for CANopen Safety protocol implementations or CODESYS runtimes) are not part of the HY-TTC 500 safety platform. Therefore, if such modules are used with safety-critical applications, these modules **shall** either be classified as 'proven in use' according to the requirements of IEC 61508 [IEC 61508], ISO 25119 [ISO 25119] and ISO 13849 [ISO 13849] or verified and validated by the system integrator according to the requirements of the associated performance level. This verification and validation also applies to generated C or object code by tools used during application development.
Question:  What is the significance of setting the **DebugKey** field of the APDB to **0xC0FFEE**?","Setting the **DebugKey** field of the APDB to **0xC0FFEE** is significant because it enables the debugging of a safety-critical I/O Driver. This specific value acts as a key or a flag that allows developers to enter a debugging mode for applications that are otherwise designed to operate under stringent safety constraints. 

In safety-critical systems, debugging is often restricted or disabled to prevent any interference with the system's normal operation, which could potentially lead to unsafe conditions. By setting the **DebugKey** to **0xC0FFEE**, developers can temporarily bypass these restrictions to troubleshoot and analyze the system's behavior without compromising the overall safety protocols.

This feature is particularly useful during the development and testing phases, where identifying and resolving issues is crucial. It allows developers to gain deeper insights into the system's operation, identify bugs, and ensure that the safety functions are working as intended. Once debugging is complete, the **DebugKey** can be reset to its default value to re-enable the full safety constraints of the system.

In summary, the **DebugKey** field set to **0xC0FFEE** provides a controlled way to enable debugging in a safety-critical environment, facilitating the development and maintenance of robust and reliable safety-critical applications."

The HY-TTC 500 uses double-channel high-side power stages. **For load leveling it is a benefit if** loads, which are switched on mutually exclusive (which means either load A, or load B is on, but not A and B at the same time), are connected to the same double-channel power stage. This reduces the thermal stress of the components. The power stage pairing is given in Section 4.12.1 on page **137.** For HS PWM output stage operating in 444–1000 Hz mode, the current limit is increased to 1 A if used in mutual exclusive mode, see Section 4.12.4.1 **on the next page.**

## 5.8 Flashing The Hy-Ttc 500

There are two ways how to flash a HY-TTC 500 device: Using the Lauterbach Debugging Device or the TTC-Downloader Tool via CAN or Ethernet. Both ways will be described step by step. For further information on each product, please refer to the respective manual.

## 5.8.1 The Lauterbach Debugging Device And Trace32 5.8.1.1 Overview

The Lauterbach product TRACE32-ICD supports a wide range of on-chip debug interfaces. The hardware for the debugger is universal and allows interfacing different target processors by simply changing the debug cable and the software. <chunk_seperator> ## 4.12.2.2 Mutual Exclusive Mode

The HY-TTC 500 uses double-channel high-side power stages. **For load leveling it is a benefit if** loads, which are switched on mutually exclusive (which means either load A, or load B is on, but not A and B at the same time), are connected to the same double-channel power stage. This reduces the thermal stress of the components. The power stage pairing is given in Section 4.12.1 on page **137.** For HS PWM output stage operating in 444–1000 Hz mode, the current limit is increased to 1 A if used in mutual exclusive mode, see Section 4.12.4.1 **on the next page.**

## 4.12.3 Maximum Ratings <chunk_seperator> ![38_image_0.png]( The image displays a computer screen with several options and settings for a software program. There are multiple windows open on the screen, each containing different information or instructions related to the program. A red highlight is placed over one of the windows, drawing attention to it.

In addition to these windows, there are two clocks visible in the image – one located near the top left corner and another towards the bottom right side. The presence of these clocks suggests that the user might be monitoring time-sensitive tasks or events related to the software program.)

![38_image_1.png]( The image displays a computer screen with a blue background and white text. On the screen, there is an advertisement for a software product called TRADE, which appears to be related to trading or finance. The advertisement includes a picture of money and a description of how to check the software's features. <chunk_seperator> pour HMG 2x/3x/4x)': 'Code art. 909414'}, {'Idéal pour formations et apprentissages  ZBE I2-000 Sonde de mesure de courant (± 5 A AC/DC)': 'Code art. 927183'}, {'Fixation magnétique (80 N force de retenue)': 'Code art. 4227226'}, {'Film de protecion écran': 'Code art. 4470677'}]</table_6>
Question:  What is the likely purpose of the message displayed on the computer screen in the third image, and what additional information might be found in the background window?","The message displayed on the computer screen in the third image [39_image_0.png] is likely related to debugging or troubleshooting an issue. The presence of two buttons, one towards the left side and another at the top right corner, suggests that the user is being prompted to make a decision or take an action to resolve the problem. The background window, which is partially visible, probably contains more detailed information about the issue being addressed. This could include error logs, diagnostic data, or specific instructions on how to proceed with the troubleshooting process.

The additional information in the background window might provide context for the error or issue at hand, such as:

1. **Error Codes or Messages**: Specific error codes or messages that can help identify the nature of the problem.
2. **Diagnostic Information**: Details about the system's current state, including hardware and software configurations, which might be relevant to the issue.
3. **Troubleshooting Steps**: A list of recommended steps or actions to take in order to resolve the issue.
4. **Logs**: System or application logs that record events leading up to the issue, which can be crucial for diagnosing the problem.
5. **Support Information**: Contact details or links to support resources, such as online help articles or forums, where the user can seek further assistance.

Overall, the message and the background window together aim to guide the user through the process of identifying and resolving the technical issue they are encountering."

In case the PWM output stages current measurement is also defined as safety-critical, the I/O driver's diagnostic module provides an implicitly executed range check that is able to detect basic failures within the current measurement path of the output stage. When detecting such failures, the I/O driver's diagnostic module will trigger an error callback. If the system integrator requires higher DC values, the implementation of additional measures (e.g. plausibility checks of the measured current values) within the application software is required.

## - - - Hs Digital Output:

If explicitly configured as digital outputs, the PWM high side stages will be operated statically and will not make use of any PWM signals. The state of such digital outputs will not be automatically monitored by the I/O driver's diagnostic modules. An according plausibility check of the digital feedback value needs to be implemented by the system integrator.

In case the PWM output stages current measurement is also defined as safety-critical, the I/O driver's diagnostic module provides an implicitly executed range check that is able to detect basic failures within the current measurement path of the output stage. When detecting such failures, the I/O driver's diagnostic module will trigger an error callback. If the system integrator requires higher DC values, the implementation of additional measures (e.g. plausibility checks of the measured current values) within the application software is required.

## - - - Hs Digital Output:

If explicitly configured as digital outputs, the PWM high side stages will be operated statically and will not make use of any PWM signals. The state of such digital outputs will not be automatically monitored by the I/O driver's diagnostic modules. An according plausibility check of the digital feedback value needs to be implemented by the system integrator.

1. **Recommendation**:
   - For inexperienced users, it is recommended to use the CAN option.

2. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Use the Ethernet port of your computer and connect it to the Ethernet port of the HY-TTC 500. A point-to-point Ethernet connection is mandatory.

3. **Software Setup**:
   - Open the TTC-Downloader tool on your computer.

4. **Default Connection Settings**:
   - If the target has no application and no CODESYS runtime system flashed, use the default connection settings. Open the **Preferences** dialog box (e.g., with **Ctrl + P**) and click **Default**.

5. **Custom Ethernet Settings**:
   - If the target has an application or CODESYS runtime system flashed, enter the correct Ethernet settings. If the correct Ethernet settings are unknown, use the CAN method to connect as described above.
   - To set the correct Ethernet settings, open the **Preferences** dialog box (e.g., with **Ctrl + P**), enter the values, and click **Apply**.

By following these steps, you can establish a connection with the HY-TTC 500 using either the CAN or Ethernet method, depending on your specific requirements and the current state of the device."

Question:  What is recommended for inexperienced users of the HY-TTC 500 when choosing between CAN and Ethernet connection options?","For inexperienced users of the HY-TTC 500, it is recommended to use the CAN connection option rather than the Ethernet connection. This recommendation is made because the CAN connection process is generally simpler and more straightforward. Additionally, if an application is already flashed to the target device, the Ethernet connection requires the application to listen to download requests, which may not be the case with the example application provided in the Quick Start Guide. Therefore, using the CAN option helps avoid potential complications and ensures a smoother connection process."

## 7.8.1 Detailed Description

IO Driver functions for handling Ethernet download requests.

Because an Ethernet link establishment can take up to 3 seconds, any Ethernet download request from the TTC-Downloader cannot be checked during power up (as it is the case for CAN). To make it possible anyway, the DOWNLOAD module can be used for. It's being initialized with **IO_DOWNLOAD_**
Init(). The DOWLNLOAD module automatically checks for TTC-Downloader requests on the Ethernet interface. This request consists of a handshake between the **TTC-Downloader and the ECU. To**
check, if any request is pending, IO_DOWNLOAD_CheckRequest() **can be used.**
After a detected request, the application has a time of 3 seconds to launch the download mode.

Within this time, the application needs to shut down and all non-volatile memories need to be stored. <chunk_seperator> ## 6 Memory Mapping 6.1 Memory Map For Internal Flash And Ram

## 7.8.1 Detailed Description

IO Driver functions for handling Ethernet download requests.

Because an Ethernet link establishment can take up to 3 seconds, any Ethernet download request from the TTC-Downloader cannot be checked during power up (as it is the case for CAN). To make it possible anyway, the DOWNLOAD module can be used for. It's being initialized with **IO_DOWNLOAD_**
Init(). The DOWLNLOAD module automatically checks for TTC-Downloader requests on the Ethernet interface. This request consists of a handshake between the **TTC-Downloader and the ECU. To**
check, if any request is pending, IO_DOWNLOAD_CheckRequest() **can be used.**
After a detected request, the application has a time of 3 seconds to launch the download mode.

Within this time, the application needs to shut down and all non-volatile memories need to be stored. <chunk_seperator> ## 6 Memory Mapping 6.1 Memory Map For Internal Flash And Ram

Question:  What information is provided in the memory map for internal flash and RAM for the HY-TTC 500 controllers?","The memory map for internal flash and RAM for the HY-TTC 500 controllers provides detailed information about the start addresses and sizes of various memory regions. Here is a breakdown of the information:

### Internal Flash Memory:
1. **Bootloader**:
   - **Start Address**: 0x00000000
   - **Size**: 131072 Bytes

2. **FPGA IP**:
   - **Start Address**: 0x00020000
   - **Size**: 524288 Bytes

3. **APDB + CRC**:
   - **Start Address**: 0x000A0000
   - **Size**: 256 Bytes

4. **Application**:
   - **Start Address**: 0x000A0100
   - **Size**: 2490112 Bytes

5. **Application Configuration Data**:
   - **Start Address**: 0xF0200000
   - **Size**: 65536 Bytes

### Internal RAM:
- **Start Address**: 0x08003000

This memory map is crucial for understanding how the internal flash and RAM are organized within the HY-TTC 500 controllers. It specifies where each component, such as the bootloader, FPGA IP, application, and configuration data, is stored and how much space each occupies. This information is essential for developers working on firmware updates, memory management, and ensuring the integrity of the application configuration data, which is not protected by the application CRC and must be managed by the application itself. For more detailed procedures on modifying the flash memory, the documentation **help.chm** for the TTC-Downloader should be referred to."

Debug LEDs The LEDs LED0. . . LED2 shown in Figure 5.42 on this page are for debugging. They are controlled by the **IO_DEBUG_SetOutputPin()** function. See [4] for details. They are completely controllable by the application.

Signal pins The signal pins on the JTAG adapter board (see Figure 5.43 on the next page) indicate the inverted status of the DONE LED and the Debug LEDs. That is, if a LED is ON, the corresponding signal pin has low voltage (0).

Note: The signal pins shown in Figure 5.43 on the following page are unprotected CMOS outputs.

Any external voltage applied on these pins can damage the ECU. <chunk_seperator> - IO_ErrorType IO_DOWNLOAD_Launch **(void)**
Restarts the ECU in Ethernet download mode.

## 7.8.1 Detailed Description

IO Driver functions for handling Ethernet download requests.

Because an Ethernet link establishment can take up to 3 seconds, any Ethernet download request from the TTC-Downloader cannot be checked during power up (as it is the case for CAN). To make it possible anyway, the DOWNLOAD module can be used for. It's being initialized with **IO_DOWNLOAD_**
Init(). The DOWLNLOAD module automatically checks for TTC-Downloader requests on the Ethernet interface. This request consists of a handshake between the **TTC-Downloader and the ECU. To**
check, if any request is pending, IO_DOWNLOAD_CheckRequest() **can be used.**
After a detected request, the application has a time of 3 seconds to launch the download mode.

Within this time, the application needs to shut down and all non-volatile memories need to be stored. <chunk_seperator> ## 6 Memory Mapping 6.1 Memory Map For Internal Flash And Ram

The following table specifies the start address and size of the bootloader, FPGA IP, APDB, **application** and **application configuration data** for the HY-TTC 500 controllers. See also the file mem_ttc500_bl.lsf, which is delivered with the package.

Note: A compatible FPGA is delivered with the package. Note: The application configuration data region is not protected by the application CRC and thus, its integrity must be ensured by the application itself. For detailed information about modifying the flash memory, refer to the documentation **help.chm** for the TTC-Downloader, page **Modifying Flash/EEPROM Memory**.

HY-TTC 500 Start Address **Size**

![51_image_0.png]( The image displays a diagram that illustrates various layers of data storage and processing. There are four main sections within this diagram, each representing different levels of data handling. <chunk_seperator> In the **Preferences** dialog box, open the **Ethernet** tab, select the used Ethernet adapter in the Network Adapter dropdown menu, and click **Apply**.

Close the **Preferences** dialog box. Now power on the target. Start the connection procedure by pressing F5. After successful connection, the downloader will identify the device and prepare the flashing process (see Figure 5.48(b) on this page).

## 5.8.2.3 Flashing To Hy-Ttc 500

After successful connection via CAN or Ethernet, you can open your **.hex**-file and flash the device with the Download icon in the **Application Download** group in the Node area.
