The IO_MPU module in the I/O Driver allows limited control of four highest-priority regions, while the other eight regions are used to configure default access privileges to all available areas of the CPU address space and are invisible to the user.\n\nThe MPU protection policies offered by the I/O Driver include:\n\n1. Legacy approach: Only protects sensitive data in the RAM.\n2. IO_MPU_POLICY_ALL_REGIONS: Allows for more thorough protection by including, for example, the CPU peripherals.\n\nThe user application can select the desired memory protection policy based on its safety level requirements. The MPU allows the user to set the access attributes of certain parts of the memory. If an address falls within more than one enabled region, the one with the greater ID has higher priority and determines the access rights. If a region is disabled, it does not affect the access rights in any way.\n\nAdditionally, the I/O Driver provides functions for initializing and enabling/disabling the User MPU regions to control the access permissions to memories or memory-mapped peripherals. The I/O Driver start-up code ensures that all available memory is fully accessible by default, and the intended use of the User MPU regions is to restrict (deny) access to sensitive memory areas for unsafe code.', 'What are the three different MPU protection policies offered by the I/O Driver, and how do they differ in terms of memory protection?': 'What is the difference between IO_MPU_POLICY_REGION0 and IO_MPU_POLICY_ALLREGIONS?', 'Describe the purpose and functionality of the IO_MPU module within the I/O Driver.': "The IO_MPU (Memory Protection Unit) module is a part of the I/O Driver that provides memory protection features to ensure the integrity and security of the system. Its primary purpose is to allow the user to set access attributes for certain parts of the memory, thereby controlling how the memory is accessed and used.\n\nThe IO_MPU module enables the user to configure the memory protection by defining regions of the memory with specific access permissions. These regions can be set to have read-only, read-write, or execute permissions, thereby preventing unauthorized access or modification of the memory contents.\n\nThe module provides functions to initialize and configure the MPU regions, set the access permissions, and enable or disable the protection for specific regions. It also allows the user to define subregions within a region, providing a more granular control over the memory access.\n\nIn the context of the I/O Driver, the IO_MPU module plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety and reliability of the system by preventing the I/O Driver's internal tasks from accessing or modifying sensitive areas of the memory. This is particularly important when the I/O Driver is used in conjunction with other components or applications that require memory protection.\n\nIn summary, the IO_MPU module is a vital component of the I/O Driver that provides memory protection features, enabling the user to configure and control access to specific regions of the memory, thereby ensuring the integrity and security of the system.", 'What happens when the CPU attempts to access memory without sufficient permissions, and how is the application notified of such violations?': 'When the CPU attempts to access memory for which it does not have sufficient permissions, one of two CPU exceptions will occur: Data Abort for data accesses, and Prefetch Abort for instruction fetches.
