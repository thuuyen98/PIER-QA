The MPU protection policies, such as IO_MPU_POLICY_REGION0, IO_MPU_POLICY_OFF, and IO_MPU_POLICY_ALLREGIONS, can be used to configure the memory protection. The IO_MPU module allows the user to initialize and enable/disable four highest-priority User MPU regions to control the access permissions to memories or memory-mapped peripherals.

When a User MPU region is configured to deny access to one of the I/O Driver memory sections, this region has to be disabled from the API before any I/O Driver function can be called.\n\nDuring interrupts, the behavior depends on the selected MPU protection policy.
